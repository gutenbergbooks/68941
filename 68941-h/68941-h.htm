<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> have</span> moved. I am in.</p>

<p>The household gods that have lain four years
in storage are grouped round me, showing familiar
faces. It’s nice of them not to have changed more,
grown up as children do or got older like one’s
friends. They don’t harmonize with the furniture&mdash;this
is an <i>appartement meublé</i>&mdash;but I can melt them
in with cushions and hangings.</p>

<p>It’s going to be very snug and cozy when I get settled.
This room&mdash;the parlor&mdash;is a good shape, an
oblong ending in a bulge of bay window. Plenty of
sun in the morning&mdash;I can have plants. Outside the
window is a small tin roof with a list to starboard
where rain-water lodges and sparrows come to take
fussy excited baths. Across the street stands a row
of brownstone fronts, blank-visaged houses with a
white curtain in every window. The faces of such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>houses are like the faces of the people who live in
them. They tell you nothing about what’s going on
inside. It’s a peculiarity of New York&mdash;after living
in a house with an expressionless front wall you get
an expressionless front wall yourself.</p>

<p>From the windows of the back room I look out
on the flank of the big apartment-house that stands
on the corner, and little slips of yard, side by side,
with fences between. Among them ours has a lost
or strayed appearance. Never did an unaspiring,
city-bred yard look more homesick and out of place.
It has a sun-dial in the middle, circled by a flagged
path, and in its corners, sheltered by a few discouraged
shrubs, several weather-worn stone ornaments.
It suggests a cemetery of small things that had to
have correspondingly small tombstones. I hear from
Mrs. Bushey, the landlady, that a sculptress once
lived on the lower floor and spent three hundred
dollars lifting it out of the sphere in which it was
born.</p>

<p>I am going to like it here. I am going to make
myself like it, get out of the negative habit into the
positive. That’s why I came back from Europe, that
a sudden longing for home, for Broadway, and the
lights along the Battery, and dear little Diana poised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>against the sky. Four years of pension tables and
third-class railway carriages do not develop the positive
habit. I was becoming negative to the point of
annihilation. I wanted to be braced by the savage
energies of my native city. And also I did want
some other society than that of American spinsters
and widows. The Europeans must wonder how the
land of the free and the home of the brave keeps up
its birth-rate&mdash; But I digress.</p>

<p>When you have an income of one hundred and
sixty-five dollars a month and no way of adding to
it, are thirty-three and a widow of creditable antecedents,
the difficulties of living in New York are almost
insurmountable. If you were a pauper or a
millionaire it would be an easy matter. They represent
the upper and the nether millstones between
which people like me are crushed.</p>

<p>And then your friends insist on being considered.
I had a dream of six rooms on the upper West Side.
“But the upper West Side, my dear! You might as
well be in Chicago.” Then I had revolutionary longings
for a tiny old house with no heat and a sloping
roof in Greenwich Village&mdash; “I could never go to
see you there. They would stone the motor,” ended
that. There is just one slice in the center of the city
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>in which a poor but honest widow can live to the satisfaction
of everybody but herself. So here I am in
the decorous Seventies, between Park Avenue and
Lexington, in an eighteen-foot dwelling with floors
for light housekeeping.</p>

<p>To enter you go down three steps to a little front
door that tries to keep up to the neighborhood by
hiding its decrepitude behind an iron grill. That
lets you into the smallest vestibule in the world,
where four bells are ranged along the door-post and
four letter-boxes cling to the wall. Out of this open
two more doors, one that gives egress to a narrow
flight of stairs without a hand-rail, and the other to
the ground-floor apartment, inhabited, so Mrs.
Bushey tells me, by a trained nurse and her aunt.
There was a tailor there once, but Mrs. Bushey got
him out&mdash; “Cockroaches, water bugs, and then the
sign! It lowered the tone of the house. A person like
you,” Mrs. Bushey eyed me approvingly, “would
never have stood for a tradesman’s sign.”</p>

<p>I murmured an assent. I always do when credited
with exclusive tastes I ought to have and
haven’t. It was the day I came to look the place
over, and I was nervously anxious to make a good
impression on Mrs. Bushey. Then we mounted a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>narrow stair that rose through a well to upper stories.
As it approached the landing it took a spirited
curve, as if in the hope of finding something better
above. The stairway was dark and a faint thin scent
of many things (I know it now to be a composite
of cooking, gas leakage and cigars) remained suspended
in the airless shaft.</p>

<p>“On this floor,” said Mrs. Bushey, turning on the
curve, as if in the hope of finding something better
up behind her, “the gas is never put out.”</p>

<p>I took that floor. I don’t know whether the gas
decided it, or Mrs. Bushey’s persuasive manners, or
an exhaustion that led me to look with favor upon
anything that had a chair to sit on and a bed to sleep
in. Anyway, I took it, and the next day burst in
upon Betty Ferguson, trying to carry it off with a
debonair nonchalance: “Well, I’ve got an apartment
at last.”</p>

<p>Betty looked serious and asked questions: Was it
clean? Did the landlady seem a proper person?
Had I seen any of the other lodgers? Then dwelt on
the brighter side: It’s not quite a block from Park
Avenue. If you don’t like it you can find some excuse
to break your lease. There <i>is</i> a servant on the
premises who will come in, clean up and cook you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>one good meal so you won’t starve. Well, it doesn’t
sound so bad.</p>

<p>And now I’m in I think it’s even less bad than it
sounded. The front room is going to make the impression.
It is already getting an atmosphere, the
individuality of a lady of uncultivated literary tastes
is imposing itself upon the department-store background.
The center table&mdash;mission style&mdash;is beginning
to have an air, with Bergson in yellow paper
covers and two volumes of Strindberg. No more of
him for me after <i>Miss Juliet</i>, but he has his uses
thrown carelessly on a table with other gentlemen of
the moment. If I am ever written up in the papers I
feel sure the reporters will say, “Mrs. Drake’s parlor
gave every evidence of being the abode of a woman
of culture and refinement.”</p>

<p>The back room (there are only two) is more intimate.
I am going to eat there and also sleep. Friends
may come in, however; for the bed, during the day,
masquerades as a divan. A little group of my ancestors&mdash;miniatures
and photographs of portraits&mdash;hangs
on the wall and chaperons me. Between the
two rooms stretches a narrow connecting neck of
bathroom and kitchenette.</p>

<p>There is only one word that describes the kitchenette&mdash;it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
is cute. When I look at it with a gas stove
on one side and tiers of shelves on the other, “cute”
instinctively rises to my lips, and I feel that my
country has enriched the language with that untranslatable
adjective. No one has ever been able to give
it a satisfactory definition, but if you got into my
kitchenette, which just holds one fair-sized person,
and found yourself able to cook with one hand and
reach the dishes off the shelves with the other, you
would get its full meaning.</p>

<p>Before the house was cut into floors the kitchenette
must have been a cupboard. I wonder if a lady’s
clothes hung in it or the best china was stored there.
There is a delightful mystery about old houses and
their former occupants. Haven’t I read somewhere
that walls absorb impressions from the lives they
have looked on and exhale them to the pleasure or
detriment of later comers?</p>

<p>Last night, as I was reading in bed&mdash;a habit acquired
at the age of twelve and adhered to ever since&mdash;I
remembered this and wondered what the walls
would exhale on me. The paper has a trailing design
of roses on it, very ugly and evidently old. I
wondered if the roses had bloomed round tragedy
or comedy, or just that fluctuation between the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>which makes up the lives of most of us&mdash;an alternate
rise and fall, soaring upward to a height, dropping
downward to a hollow.</p>

<p>Five years ago mine dropped to its hollow, and
ever since has been struggling up to the dead level
where it is now&mdash;the place where things come without
joy or pain, the edge off everything. Thirty-three
and the high throb of expectancy over, the big
possibilities left behind. The hiring of two rooms,
the hanging of a curtain, the placing of a vase&mdash;these
are the things that for me must take the place
that love and home and children take in other women’s
lives.</p>

<p>I got this far and stopped. No, I wouldn’t. I
came back from Europe to get away from that. I
put out the light and cuddled down in the new bed.
Quite a good bed if it is a divan, and the room is going
to be fairly quiet. Muffled by walls I could hear
the clanging passage of cars. And then far away it
seemed, though it couldn’t have been, a gramophone,
the Caruso record of <i>La Donna e Mobile</i>. What a
fine swaggering song and what an outrageous falsehood!
Woman is changeable&mdash;is she? That’s the
man’s privilege. We, poor fools, haven’t the sense
to do anything but cling, if not to actualities to memories.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
I felt tears coming&mdash;<i>that</i> hasn’t happened for
years. My memories don’t bring them, they only
bring a sort of weary bitterness. It was the new surroundings,
the loneliness, that did it. I stopped them
and listened to the gramophone, and the wretched
thing had begun on a new record, <i>Una Lagrima
Furtiva</i>&mdash;a furtive tear!</p>

<p>With my own furtive tears, wet on the pillow, I
couldn’t help laughing.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> is one thing in the front room I must
get rid of&mdash;the rug. It is a nightmare with a
crimson ground on which are displayed broken white
particles that look like animalcula in a magnified
drop of water. I had just made up my mind that it
must be removed when Mrs. Bushey opportunely
came in.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bushey lives next door (she has two houses
under her wing) and when not landladying, teaches
physical culture. I believe there is no Mr. Bushey,
though whether death or divorce has snatched him
from her I haven’t heard. She is a stout dark person
somewhere from twenty-eight to forty-eight&mdash;I can’t
tell age. I am thirty-three and have wrinkles round
my eyes. She has none. It may be temperament, or
fat, or the bony structure of the skull, or an absence
of furtive tears.</p>

<p>She talks much and rapidly which ought to tend
to a good combination between us, as listening is one
of the things I do best. From our conversation, or
perhaps I ought to say our monologue, I got an impressionistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
effect of my fellow lodgers past and
present. The lady who lived here before me was a
writer and very close about money. It was difficult
to collect her rent, also she showed symptoms of inebriety.
I gathered from Mrs. Bushey’s remarks and
expression that she expected me to be shocked, and
I tried not to disappoint her, but I couldn’t do much
with a monosyllable, which was all she allowed me.</p>

<p>A series of rapid sketches of the present inmates
followed. Something like this:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Phillips, the trained nurse, and her aunt, in
the basement are terrible cranks, always complaining
about the plumbing and the little boys who will stop
on their way home from school and write bad words
on the flags. They think they own the back garden,
but they don’t. We all do, but what’s the use of
fighting? I never do, I’ll stand anything rather than
have words with anybody.”</p>

<p>I edged in an exclamation, a single formless
syllable.</p>

<p>“Of course, I knew you would. Then on the floor
below you are two young Westerners in the back
room, Mr. Hazard, who’s an artist, and Mr. Weatherby,
who’s something on the press. The most delightful
fellows, never a day late with their rent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>And in the front room is Miss Bliss, a model&mdash;artist
not cloak. She isn’t always on time with her money,
but I’m very lenient with her.”</p>

<p>I tried to insert a sentence, but it was nipped at the
second word.</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly. You see just how it is. On the
floor above you, in the back, is Mr. Hamilton, such a
nice man and so unfortunate. Lost every cent he had
in Wall Street and is beginning all over again.
Fine, isn’t it? Yes, I feel it and don’t say anything
when he’s behind with his rent. How could I?”
Though I hadn’t said a word she looked at me reprovingly
as if I had suggested sending the delinquent
Mr. Hamilton to jail. “That’s not my way.
I know it’s foolish of me. You needn’t tell me so, but
that’s how I’m made.”</p>

<p>I began to feel that I ought to offer my next
month’s rent at once. I have a bad memory and
might be a day or two late.</p>

<p>“The room in front, over your parlor, is vacant.
Terrible, isn’t it? I tried to make Mr. Hamilton take
the whole floor through. Even if he isn’t good
pay&mdash;”</p>

<p>I broke in, determined to hear no more of Mr.
Hamilton’s financial deficiencies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>
<p>“Who’s on the top floor?”</p>

<p>There was a slight abatement of Mrs. Bushey’s
buoyancy. She looked at me with an eye that expressed
both curiosity and question.</p>

<p>“Miss Harris lives there,” she answered. “Have
you seen her?”</p>

<p>I hadn’t.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ve heard her?”</p>

<p>I had heard a rustle on the stairs, was that Miss
Harris?</p>

<p>“Yes. She’s the only woman above you.”</p>

<p>“Does she leave a trail of perfume?”</p>

<p>I was going to add that it didn’t mix well with
the gas leakage, the cigars and last year’s cooking
but refrained for fear of Mrs. Bushey’s feelings.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s Miss Harris. She’s a singer&mdash;professional.
But you won’t hear her much, there’s a
floor in between. That is, unless you leave the register
open.”</p>

<p>I said I’d shut the register.</p>

<p>“I don’t take singers as a rule,” Mrs. Bushey went
on, “but Mr. Hamilton being away all day and the
top floor being hard to rent, I made an exception.
One must live, mustn’t one?”</p>

<p>I could agree to that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“She’s a Californian and rather good-looking.
But I don’t think she’s had much success.”</p>

<p>A deprecating look came into her face and she
tilted her head to one side. I felt coming revelations
about Miss Harris’ rent and said hastily:</p>

<p>“What does she sing, concert, opera, musical
comedy?”</p>

<p>“She’s hardly sung in public at all yet. She’s
studying, and I’m afraid that it’s very uncertain.
Last month&mdash;”</p>

<p>I interrupted desperately.</p>

<p>“Is she a contralto or soprano?”</p>

<p>“Dramatic mezzo,” said Mrs. Bushey. “She’s
trying to get an opening, but,” she compressed her
lips and shook her head gloomily, “there are so
many of them and her voice is nothing wonderful.
But she evidently has some money, for she pays her
rent regularly.”</p>

<p>I felt immensely relieved. As Mrs. Bushey rose to
her feet I too rose lightly, encouragingly smiling.
Mrs. Bushey did not exhibit the cheer fitting to the
possession of so satisfactory a lodger. She buttoned
her jacket, murmuring:</p>

<p>“I don’t like taking singers, people complain so.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>But when one is working for one’s living&mdash;” Her
fingers struggled with a button.</p>

<p>“Of course,” I filled in, “I understand. And I
for one won’t object to the music.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bushey seemed appeased. As she finished
the buttoning she looked about the room, her glance
roaming over my possessions. For some obscure reason
I flinched before that inspection. Some of them
are sacred, relics of my mother and of the years
when I was a wife&mdash;only a few of these. Mrs.
Bushey’s look was like an auctioneer’s hand fingering
them, appraising their value.</p>

<p>Finally it fell to the rug. I had forgotten it; now
was my chance. Suddenly it seemed a painful subject
to broach and I sought for a tactful opening.
Mrs. Bushey pressed its crimson surface with her
foot.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a beautiful rug?” she said. “It’s a
real Samarcand.”</p>

<p>I smothered a start. I had had a real Samarcand
once.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bushey, eying the magnified insects with
solicitude, continued:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to tell you how much I paid for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>this. It was a ridiculous sum for me to give. But I
love pretty things, and when you took the apartment
I put it in here because I saw at once <i>you</i> were used
to only the best.”</p>

<p>I murmured faintly.</p>

<p>“So I was generous and gave you my treasure.
You will be careful of it, won’t you? Not drop anything
on it or let people come in with muddy boots.”</p>

<p>I said I would. I found myself engaging with
ardor to love and cherish a thing I abhorred. It’s
happened before, it’s the kind of thing I’ve been
doing all my life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bushey gave it a loving stroke with her foot.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d appreciate it. You don’t often find
a real Samarcand in a furnished apartment.”</p>

<p>After she had gone I sat looking dejectedly at it.
Of course I would have to keep it now. I might buy
some small rugs and partly cover it up, but I suppose,
when she saw them, she would be mortally
hurt. And I can’t do that. I’d rather have those
awful magnified insects staring up at me for the rest
of my life than wound her pride so.</p>

<p>As to its being a Samarcand&mdash;I took up one corner
and lo! attached to it by a string was a price-tag
bearing the legend, Scotch wool rug, $12.75.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>It <i>was</i> somewhat of a shock. Suppose I had found
it while she was there! The thought of such a contretemps
made me cold. To avoid all possibilities of
it ever happening I stealthily detached the tag and
tore it into tiny pieces. As I dropped them in the
waste-basket I had a fancy that had I made the discovery
while she was present, I would have been
the more embarrassed of the two.</p>

<p>All afternoon I have been putting things in order,
trying them and standing back to get the effect. It’s
a long time since I’ve had belongings of my own to
play with. I hung my mother’s two Kriegolf’s
(Kriegolf was a Canadian artist who painted pictures
of habitan life) in four different places. They
finally came to anchor on the parlor wall on either
side of a brass-framed mirror with candle branches
that belongs to Mrs. Bushey. Opposite, flanking the
fireplace, are <i>Kitty O’Brien</i> and <i>The Wax Head
of Lille</i>. I love her best of all, the dreaming
maiden. I like to try and guess what she’s thinking
of. Is it just the purposeless reverie of youth, or is
she musing on the coming lover? It can’t be that,
because, while he’s still a dream lover, a girl is
happy, and she looks so sad.</p>

<p>I was trying to pierce the secret of that mysterious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>face when the telephone rang. It was Roger Clements,
a kind voice humming along the line&mdash;“Well,
how’s everything?” Roger wanted to come up and
see me and the kitchenette, and I told him Madame
would receive to-morrow evening.</p>

<p>He would be my first visitor and I was fluttered.
I spent at least an hour trying to decide whether I’d
better bring the Morris chair from the back room
for him. When the dread of starvation is lifted from
you by one hundred and sixty-five dollars a month
and life offers nothing, you find your mental forces
expending themselves on questions like that. I once
knew a man who told me he sat on the edge of his
bed every morning struggling to decide whether
he’d put on a turned-down or a stand-up collar. He
said it was nerves. In my case it’s just plain lack
of interests.</p>

<p>It’s natural for me to try and make Roger comfortable.
He’s one of the best friends I have in the
world. I’m not using the word to cover sentiment, I
do really mean a friend. He knew me before I was
married, was one of the reliable older men in those
glowing days when I was Evelyn Carr, before I met
Harmon Drake. He has been kind to me in ways I
never can forget. In those dark last years of my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>married life (there were only five of them altogether)
when my little world was urging divorce
and I stood distracted amid falling ruins, he never
said one word to me about my husband, never forced
on me consolation or advice. I don’t forget that, or
the letter he wrote me when Harmon died&mdash;the one
honest letter I got.</p>

<p>Everybody exclaimed when I said I was going
alone to Europe. Roger was the only one who understood
and told me to go. I’ll carry to my grave
the memory of his face as he stood on the dock waving
me good-by. He was smiling, but under the
smile I could see the sympathy he wanted me to
know and didn’t dare to put in words. That’s one of
the ties between us&mdash;we’re the silent kind who keep
our feelings hidden away in a Bluebeard’s chamber
of which we keep the key.</p>

<p>I used to hear from him off and on in Europe, and
I followed him in the American papers. I remember
one sun-soaked morning in Venice, when I picked
up an English review in the pension and read a
glowing criticism of his book of essays, <i>Readjustments</i>.
How proud I was of him! He’s become
quite famous in these last few years, not vulgarly
famous but known among scholars as a scholar and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>recognized as one of the few stylists we have over
here. I can’t imagine him on the news-stalls, or
bound in paper for the masses. I think he secretly
detests the masses though he won’t admit it. The
mob, with its easily swayed passions, is the sort of
thing that it’s in his blood to hate. If he had to
sue for its support like Coriolanus he would act
exactly as Coriolanus did. Fortunately he doesn’t
need it. The Clements have had money for generations,
not according to Pittsburgh standards, but the
way the Clements reckon money. He has an apartment
on Gramercy Park, lined with books to the
ceilings, with a pair of old servants to fuss over him
and keep the newspaper people away.</p>

<p>There he leads the intellectual life, the only one
that attracts him. He rarely goes into society. The recent
invasion of multi-millionaires have spoiled it,
his sister, Mrs. Ashworth, says, and on these points
he and she think alike. And he doesn’t care for
women, at least to fall in love with them. When he
was a young man, twenty-four to be accurate, he
was engaged to a girl who died. Since then his interest
in the other sex has taken the form of a detached
impersonal admiration. He thinks they furnish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the color and poetry of life and in that way have
an esthetic value in a too sober world.</p>

<p>But what’s the sense of analyzing your friend?
He’s a dear kind anchorite of a man, just a bit set,
just a bit inclined to think that the Clements’ way
of doing things is the only way, just a bit too contemptuous
of cheapness and bad taste and bounce,
but with all his imperfections on his head, the finest
gentleman I know. I <i>will</i> move the Morris chair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ove</span> of flowers is one of the gifts the fairies gave
me in my cradle. It’s a great possession, fills
so many blanks. You can forget you’ve got no baby
of your own when you watch the flowers’ babies
lifting their little faces to the sun.</p>

<p>I bought four plants at Bloomingdales and put
them in the front window, a juniper bush, a Boston
fern, a carrot fern and a rubber plant. I like the
ferns best, the new shoots are so lovely, pushing up
little green curly tops in the shelter of the old strong
ones. I remind myself of Miss Lucretia Tox in
<i>Dombey and Son</i>, with a watering can and a pair of
scissors to snip off dead leaves. There’s one great
difference between us&mdash;Miss Tox had a Mr. Dombey
across the way. I’ve nothing across the way.
The only male being that that discreet and expressionless
row of houses has given up to my eyes is
the young doctor opposite. He does the same thing
every morning, runs down the steps with a bag and
a busy air, walks rapidly to Lexington Avenue,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>then, when he thinks he’s out of sight, stands on the
corner not knowing which way to go.</p>

<p>I feel that, in a purely neighborly spirit, I ought
to have an illness. I would like to help all young
people starting in business, take all the hansoms
that go drearily trailing along Fifth Avenue, especially
if the driver looks drunken and despondent,
and give money to every beggar who accosts me.
They say it is a bad principle and one is always
swindled. Personally I don’t think that matters at
all. Your impulse is all right and that’s all that
counts. But I digress again&mdash;I must get over the
habit.</p>

<p>This morning I was doing my Miss Lucretia Tox
act when Betty Ferguson came in. Betty is one of
my rich friends; we were at school together and
have kept close ever since. She married Harry
Ferguson the same year that I married Harmon
Drake. Now she has three children, and a house on
Fifth Avenue, not to mention Harry. Her crumpled
rose leaf is that she is getting fat. Every time I
see her she says resolutely, “I am going to walk
twice round the reservoir to-morrow morning,” and
never does it.</p>

<p>She came in blooming, with a purple orchid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>among her furs, and the rich rosy color in her face
deepened by the first nip of winter. She has a
sharp eye, and I expected she would immediately
see the rug and demand an explanation. I was
slightly flustered, for I have no excuse ready and I
never can confess my weaknesses to Betty. She is
one of the sensible people who don’t see why you
can’t be sensible, too.</p>

<p>She did not, however, notice the rug, but clasping
my hand fixed me with a solemn glance that
made me uneasy. Betty oblivious to externals&mdash;what
had I done?</p>

<p>“Who was the woman I met coming out of here
just now?” she said abruptly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bushey,” I hazarded, and then remembered
Mrs. Bushey was off somewhere imparting physical
culture.</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Bushey very tall and thin with black
hair and a velvet dress, and a hat as big as a tea
tray?”</p>

<p>“No, she’s short and stout and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Evie,” interrupted Mrs. Ferguson, sounding a
deep note, “that woman wasn’t Mrs. Bushey. Nobody
who looked like that ever leased an eighteen-foot
house and rented out floors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>I had a sudden surge of memory&mdash;</p>

<p>“It must have been Miss Harris.”</p>

<p>Betty loosed my hand and sank upon the sofa,
that is, she subsided carefully upon the sofa, as erect
as a statue from the waist up. She threw back her
furs with a disregard for the orchid that made me
wince.</p>

<p>“Who’s Miss Harris?” she said sternly.</p>

<p>I told her all I knew.</p>

<p>“That’s just what she looked like&mdash;the stage. Are
there any more of them here?”</p>

<p>I assured her there were not. She gazed out of
the window with a pondering air.</p>

<p>“After all, there <i>are</i> respectable people on the
stage,” she said, following some subterranean course
of thought.</p>

<p>I knew my Betty and hastened to reassure her&mdash;</p>

<p>“She’s on the top floor. Her contaminating influence,
if she has one, would have to percolate
through another apartment before it got to me.”</p>

<p>She did not smile and I did not expect it. Mrs.
Ferguson has no sense of humor, and that’s one of
the reasons I love her. There is an obsession in the
public mind just now about the sense of humor. People
ask anxiously if other people have it as Napoleon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>used to ask if attractive ladies he had wooed in vain
“were still virtuous.” It’s like being a bromide&mdash; Give
me a bromide, a humorless, soft, cushiony bromide,
rather than those exhausting people who have
established a reputation for wit and are living up to
it. Betty is not soft and cushiony, but she is always
herself.</p>

<p>“I wish you could live in a house of your own like
a Christian,” she said.</p>

<p>We have talked over this before. This subject
has an embarrassing side&mdash;I’ll explain it later&mdash;so I
hastened to divert her.</p>

<p>“Why should you be wrought up over Miss Harris?
I’m sure from what Mrs. Bushey tells me she’s a
very nice person,” and then I remembered and
added brightly: “She always pays her rent.”</p>

<p>Betty gave me a somber side glance.</p>

<p>“She’s very handsome.”</p>

<p>“There <i>are</i> handsome people who are perfectly
<i>convenable</i>. You’re handsome, Betty.”</p>

<p>Betty was unmoved.</p>

<p>“At any rate you needn’t know her,” she said.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I ought to say ‘Howd’ye do’ if
I meet her on the stairs?”</p>

<p>“No, why should you? The next thing would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>she’d be coming into your rooms and then, some
day, she’d come when somebody you liked was
there.”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in her lap and drew herself
up, her head so erect the double chin she fears
was visible. In this attitude she kept a cold eye on
me.</p>

<p>“And all because she’s handsome and wears a hat
as big as a tea tray,” I said, trying to treat the subject
lightly, but inwardly conscious of a perverse desire
to champion Miss Harris.</p>

<p>Betty, wreathing her neck about in the tight grip
of her collar, removed her glance to the window,
out of which she stared haughtily as though Miss
Harris was standing on the tin roof supplicating an
entrance.</p>

<p>“We can’t be too careful in this town,” she murmured,
shaking her head as if refusing Miss Harris’
hopes. Then she looked down at the floor. I saw
her expression changing as her eye ranged over the
rug.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this rug, Evie?” she asked
in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>I grew nervous.</p>

<p>“It came with the apartment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Get rid of it, dear, at once. I can send you up
one from the library. Harry’s going to give me a
new Aubusson.”</p>

<p>I became more nervous and faltered:</p>

<p>“But I ought to keep this.”</p>

<p>“Why? Is there a clause in your lease that you’ve
got to use it?”</p>

<p>When Betty gets me against the wall this way I
become frightened. Timid animals, thus cornered,
are seized with the courage of despair and fly at
their assailant. Timid human beings show much less
spirit&mdash;I always think animals behave with more
dignity than people&mdash;they tell lies.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;I like it,” I stammered.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Betty with a falling note, “if that’s
the case&mdash;” She stopped and rose to her feet, too
polite to say what she thought. “Put on your things
and come out with me. I’m shopping, and afterward
we’ll lunch somewhere.”</p>

<p>I went out with Betty in the car, a limousine with
two men and a chow dog. We went to shops where
obsequious salesladies listened to Mrs. Ferguson’s
needs and sought to satisfy them. They had a conciliating
way of turning to me and asking my opinion
which, such is the poverty of my spirit, pleased me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>greatly. I get a faint reflex feeling of what it is to be
the wife of one of New York’s rising men. Then we
lunched richly and clambered back into the limousine,
each dropping languidly into her corner while
the footman tucked us in.</p>

<p>We were rolling luxuriously down Fifth Avenue
when Betty rallied sufficiently from the torpor of
digestion to murmur.</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning, after breakfast, I’ll walk
three times round the reservoir.”</p>

<p>Roger came at eight. It was the first cold night
of the season and the furnace was not broken in. In
spite of lamps the room was chilly. It was good to
see him again&mdash;in my parlor, in my Morris chair.
He isn’t handsome, a long thin man, with a long
thin face, smooth shaven and lined, and thick, sleek,
iron-gray hair. Some one has said all that a man
should have in the way of beauty is good teeth.
Roger has that necessary asset and another one,
well-shaped, gentlemanly hands, very supple and a
trifle dry to the touch. And, yes, he has a charming
smile.</p>

<p>He is forty-two and hasn’t changed a particle in
the last fifteen years. Why can’t a woman manage
that? When I was dressing to-night I looked in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>glass and tried to reconstruct my face as it was
fifteen years ago. I promised to be a pretty girl then,
but it was just the fleeting beauty that nature gives
us in our mating time, lends us for her own purposes.
Now I see a pale mild person with flat-lying brown
hair and that beaten expression peculiar to females
whom life conquers. I don’t know whether it’s the
mouth or the eyes, but I see it often in faces I pass
on the street.</p>

<p>It was a funny evening&mdash;conversation varied by
chamber music. We began it sitting in the middle of
the room on either side of the table like the family
lawyer and the heroine in the opening scene of a
play. Then, as the temperature dropped, we slowly
gravitated toward the register, till we finally brought
up against it. A faint warm breath came through
the iron grill and we leaned forward and basked in
it. We were talking about women. We often do, it’s
one of our subjects. Of course Roger is of the old
school. He’s got an early Victorian point of view;
I know he would value me more highly if I swooned
now and then. He doesn’t call women “the weaker
vessel,” but he thinks of them that way.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you can’t be content with things
as they are,” he said, spreading his hands to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>register’s meager warmth. “Why should you want
to go into politics and have professions? Why aren’t
you willing to leave all that to us and stay where you
belong?”</p>

<p>“But we may not have anything to do where we
belong. Roger, if you move nearer the corner you’ll
get a little more heat.”</p>

<p>Roger moved.</p>

<p>“Every woman has work in her own sphere,” he
said, while moving.</p>

<p>“I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“You, dear Evie,” he looked at me with a fond
indulgent smile. “You have plenty of work and it’s
always well done&mdash;to bring romance and sweetness
into life.”</p>

<p>There is something quite maddening about Roger
when he talks this way. I could find it in me to call
him an ass. All the superiority of countless generations
of men who have ordered women’s lives lies
behind it. And he is impregnable, shut up with his
idea. It is built round him and cemented with a
thousand years of prejudice and tradition.</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>want</i> to bring romance and sweetness into
life,” I said crossly, “I want to get something out
of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t help it. It’s what you were put in the
world for. We men don’t want you in the struggle.
That’s for us. It’s our business to go down into the
arena and fight for you, make a place for you, keep
you out of it all.”&mdash; He moved his foot across the
register and turned it off.</p>

<p>“You’ve turned off the heat,” I cried.</p>

<p>He turned it on.</p>

<p>&mdash;“Keep you out of it all. Sheltered from the
noise and glare of the world by our own firesides.”</p>

<p>“Some of us would rather have a little more noise
and glare by our own register.”</p>

<p>“All wrong, Evie, all wrong. You’re in a niche
up there with a lamp burning before it. If you come
down from your niche you’re going to lose the thing
that’s made you worshipful&mdash;your femininity, your
charm.”</p>

<p>“What does our charm matter to us? What good
is our femininity to us?”</p>

<p>He looked surprised.</p>

<p>“What good?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Roger, I feel certain that Shem, Ham
and Japheth talked this way to their wives on those
rainy days in the Ark. It’s not only a pre-glacial
point of view, but it’s the most colossally selfish one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>All you men are worried about is that we’re not going
to be so attractive to make love to. The chase
is going to lose its zest&mdash;”</p>

<p>I stopped short, cut off by a flood of sound that
suddenly burst upon us from the register.</p>

<p>It was a woman’s voice singing Musetta’s song,
and by its clearness and volume seemed to be the
breath of the register become vocal. We started back
simultaneously and looked about the room, while
Musetta’s song poured over us, a rich jubilant torrent
of melody.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Roger, rising as if to defend
me.</p>

<p>“Miss Harris,” I answered, jumping up.</p>

<p>“Who’s Miss Harris?”</p>

<p>“A singer. She lives here.”</p>

<p>“Does she live in there?” He pointed to the register.</p>

<p>“No, on the top floor, but it connects with her
room.”</p>

<p>We stood still and listened, and as the song rose
to its brilliant climax, Roger looked at me smiling,
and nodded approvingly. In his heart he thinks he
is something of a musician, has season seats at the
opera and goes dutifully to the Symphony. I don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>think he is any more musical than I am. I don’t
think literary people ever are. They like it with
their imaginations, feel its sensuous appeal, but as
to experiencing those esoteric raptures that the initiated
know&mdash;it’s a joy denied.</p>

<p>The song came to an end.</p>

<p>“Not a bad voice,” said Roger. “Who is she?”</p>

<p>“A lady who is studying to be a professional.”
And then I added spitefully: “Do you think she
ought to give up her singing to be sheltered by
somebody’s fireside?”</p>

<p>Roger had turned to get his coat. He stopped and
looked at me over his shoulder, smiling&mdash;he really
has a delightful smile.</p>

<p>“I except ladies with voices.”</p>

<p>“Because they add to the pleasure of gentlemen
with musical tastes?”</p>

<p>He picked up his coat.</p>

<p>“Evie, one of the things that strengthens me in
my belief is that when you get on that subject you
become absolutely acid.”</p>

<p>I helped him on with his coat.</p>

<p>My sitting-room door opens close to the head of
the stairs. If my visitors back out politely they run
a risk of stepping over the edge and falling down-stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
on their backs. The one gas-jet that burns all
the time is a safeguard against this catastrophe, but,
as it is an uncertain and timid flicker, I speed the
parting guest with caution.</p>

<p>Roger was backing out with his hat held to his
breast when I gave a warning cry. It went echoing
up the stairway and mingled with the sound of heavy
descending feet. A head looked over the upper banister,
a dark masculine head, and seeing nothing
more alarming than a lady and gentleman in an open
doorway, withdrew itself. The steps descended, a
hand glided down the rail, and a large overcoated
shape came into view. The frightened gas-jet shot
up as if caught in a dereliction of duty, and the man,
advancing toward us, was clearly revealed.</p>

<p>I am a person of sudden attractions and antipathies
and I had one, sharp and poignant, as I
looked at him. It was an antipathy, the “I-do-not-like-you-Doctor-Fell”
feeling in its most acute form.
It was evidently not reciprocal, for, as he drew near,
he smiled, an easy natural smile that disclosed singularly
large white teeth. He gave me an impression
of size and breadth, his shoulders seemed to fill the
narrow passage and he carried them with an arrogant
swagger. That and the stare he fixed on us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>probably caused the “Doctor Fell” feeling. The
stare was bold and hard, a combination of inspection
and curiosity.</p>

<p>He added a nod to his smile, passed us and went
down the stairs. We looked down on his wide descending
shoulders and the top of his head, with the
hair thin in the middle.</p>

<p>“Who’s that bounder?” said Roger.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he bow to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that doesn’t make me know him. He
must be some one living in the house.”</p>

<p>Roger looked after him.</p>

<p>“I’m coming up here to see you often,” he said
after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>After he had gone I went into the back room and
lit lights and peeled off the outer skins of my divan
bed. I felt quite gay and light-hearted. I <i>am</i> going
to like it here. With the student lamp lighted the
back room is very cozy. I lay in bed and surveyed it
admiringly while my ancestors looked soberly down
on me. They are a very solemn lot, all but the
French Huguenot lady with her frivolous curls and
the black velvet round her neck. She has a human
look. I’m sure her blood is strong in me. None of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>the others would ever have lived in an eighteen-foot
house with a prima donna singing through the register,
and a queer-looking man, with large white
teeth, smiling at one in the passage.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> have</span> seen her&mdash;and I don’t wonder!</p>

<p>It was on Tuesday evening just as the dusk was
falling. I had come home from a walk, and as I
climbed the first narrow stair I saw in the hall above
me, a woman standing under the gas, reading a letter.
I caught her in silhouette, a black form, very
tall and broadening out into a wide hat, but even
that way, without feature or detail, arresting. Then,
as she heard me, she stepped back so that the light
fell on her. I knew at once it was Miss Harris, tried
not to stare, and couldn’t help it.</p>

<p>She is really remarkably good-looking&mdash;an oval-faced,
dark-eyed woman, with black hair growing
low on her forehead and waving backward over her
ears. Either the size of the hat, or her earrings
(they were long and green), or a collarless effect
about the neck, gave her a picturesque, unconventional
air. The stage was written large all over her.
When I got close I saw details, that she had beautifully
curly lips&mdash;most people’s come together in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>straight line like a box and its lid&mdash;and a fine nose,
just in the right proportion to the rest of her face.
Also she wore a gray fur coat, unfastened, and something
in her appearance suggested a hurried dressing,
things flung on.</p>

<p>She looked up from the letter and eyed me with
frank interest. I approached embarrassed. A secret
desire to have all people like me is one of my besetting
weaknesses. I am slavish to servants and feel
grateful when salesladies condescend to address me
while waiting for change. The fear that Betty would
find it out could not make me pass Miss Harris without
a word. So I timidly smiled&mdash;a deprecating,
apologetic smile, a smile held in bondage by the
memory of Mrs. Ferguson.</p>

<p>Miss Harris returned it brilliantly. Her face suddenly
bore the expression of one who greets a
cherished friend. She moved toward me radiating
welcome.</p>

<p>“You’re on the third floor,” she said in a rich
voice, “Mrs. Harmon Drake.”</p>

<p>I saw a hand extended and felt mine enclosed in
a grasp that matched the smile and manner. Miss
Harris towered over me&mdash;she must be nearly six
feet high&mdash;and I felt myself growing smaller and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>paler than the Lord intended me to be before that
exuberantly beaming presence. My hand was like a
little bundle of cold sticks in her enfolding grip. I
backed against the banisters and tried to pull it
away, but Miss Harris held it and beamed.</p>

<p>“I’ve read your name on your door every time
I’ve passed,” she said, “and I’ve hoped you’d some
day open the door and find me standing there and
ask me to come in.”</p>

<p>I could see Betty’s head nodding at me, I could
hear her grim “I told you so.”</p>

<p>I made polite murmurs and pressed closer to the
banister.</p>

<p>“But the door was never opened,” said Miss Harris,
bending to look into my face with an almost
tender reproach. I felt I was visibly shrinking, and
that the upward gaze I fastened on her was one of
pleading. Unless she let go my hand and ceased
to be so oppressively gracious I would diminish to a
heap upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she went on, “now I know you
I’ll not stand outside any more.”</p>

<p>I jerked my hand away and made a flank movement
for the stairs. Five minutes more and she
would be coming up and taking supper with me.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>She did not appear to notice my desire for flight,
but continued talking to me as I ascended.</p>

<p>“We’re the only two women in the upper part of
this house. Do I chaperon you, or do you chaperon
me?”</p>

<p>I spoke over the banisters and my tone was cold.</p>

<p>“Being a married woman, I suppose I’m the
natural chaperon.”</p>

<p>The coldness glanced off her imperturbable good
humor:</p>

<p>“You never can tell. These little quiet married
women&mdash;”</p>

<p>I frowned. The changed expression stopped her
and then she laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be offended. You must never mind what I
say. I’m not half so interesting if I stop and think.”</p>

<p>I looked down at her and was weak enough to
smile. Her face was so unlike her words, so serenely
fine, almost noble.</p>

<p>“That’s right, smile,” she cried gaily. “You’ll
get used to me when you know me better. And
you’re going to do that, Mrs. Drake, for I warn you
now, we’ll soon be friends.”</p>

<p>Before I could answer she had turned and run
down the stairs to the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>I let myself into the sitting-room and took off my
things. I have neat old-maidish ways, cultivated by
years of small quarters. Before I can sit with an
easy conscience I have to put away wraps, take off
shoes, pull down blinds and light lamps. When I
had done this I sat before the register and thought
of Miss Harris.</p>

<p>There was something very unusual about her&mdash;something
more than her looks. She has a challenging
quality; maybe it’s magnetism, but whatever it
is that’s what makes people notice her and speak of
her. Nevertheless, she was not <i>de notre monde</i>&mdash;I
apologize for the phrase which has always seemed to
me the summit of snobbery, but I can’t think of a
better one. It was not that she was common&mdash;that
didn’t fit her at all&mdash;unsensitive would be a fairer
word. I felt that very strongly, and I felt that it
might be a concomitant of a sort of crude power.
She didn’t notice my reluctance at all, or I had a
fancy that she might have noticed it and didn’t care.</p>

<p>I was sitting thus when Mrs. Bushey came bounding
ebulliently in. Mrs. Bushey bounds in quite
often, after physical culture, or when the evenings
in the other house pall. She wore a red dress under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>a long fur-lined coat and stopped in pained amaze
when she saw me crouched over the register.</p>

<p>“Cold!” she cried aghast, “don’t tell me you
haven’t enough heat?”</p>

<p>It was just what I intended telling her, but when
I saw her consternation I weakened.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a little chilly this evening,” I faltered,
“but perhaps&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bushey cut me short by falling into the
Morris chair as one become limp from an unexpected
blow.</p>

<p>“What am I to do?” she wailed, looking up at the
chandelier as though she expected an answer to drop
on her from the globes. “I’ve just got four tons of
the best coal and a new furnace man. I pay him
double what any one else on the block pays&mdash;<i>double</i>&mdash;and
here you are <i>cold</i>.”</p>

<p>I felt as if I was doing Mrs. Bushey a personal
wrong&mdash;insulting her as a landlady and a woman&mdash;and
exclaimed earnestly, quite forgetting the night
Roger and I had frozen in concert.</p>

<p>“Only this evening, Mrs. Bushey, I assure you.”</p>

<p>But she was too perturbed to listen:</p>

<p>“And I try so hard&mdash;I don’t make a cent and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>don’t expect to. I want you all to be comfortable, no
matter how far behind I get. That’s my way&mdash;but
I’ve always been a fool. Oh, dear!” She let her
troubled gaze wander over the room&mdash; “Isn’t that a
beautiful mirror? It came from the Trianon, belonged
to Marie Antoinette. I took it out of my room
and put it in here for you. What <i>shall</i> I do with that
furnace man?”</p>

<p>I found myself telling her that an arctic temperature
was exactly to my taste, and making a mental
resolution that next time Roger came he could keep
on his overcoat, and after all, spring was only six
months off.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Bushey firmly, “I’ll have it right
if I go to the poorhouse, and that’s where I’m
headed. I had a carpenter’s bill to-day&mdash;twenty-six
dollars and fourteen cents&mdash;and I’ve only eleven in
the bank. It was for your floor”&mdash;she looked over
it&mdash;“I really didn’t need to have it fixed, it’s not
customary, but I was determined I’d give you a
good floor no matter what it cost.”</p>

<p>I was just about suggesting that the carpenter’s
bill be added to my next month’s rent when
she brightened up and said an Italian count had
taken the front room on the floor above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Count Mario Delcati, one of the very finest
families of Milan. A charming young fellow,
charming, with those gallant foreign manners. He’s
coming here to learn business, American methods.
I’m asking him nothing&mdash;a young man in a strange
country. How could I? And though his family’s
wealthy they’re giving him a mere pittance to live
on. Of course I won’t make anything by it, I don’t
expect to. His room’s got hardly any chairs in it,
and I can’t buy any new ones with that carpenter’s
bill hanging over me.” She smoothed the arm of the
Morris chair and then looked at the floor. “It’s
really made your floor look like parquet.”</p>

<p>I agreed, though I hadn’t thought of it before.</p>

<p>“You have a good many chairs in this room,” she
went on, “more than usually go in a furnished apartment,
even in the most expensive hotels.”</p>

<p>I had two chairs and a sofa. Mrs. Bushey rose
and drew together her fur-lined coat.</p>

<p>“It’s horrible to think of that boy with only one
chair,” she murmured, “far from his home, too. Of
course I’d give him any I had, but mine are all gone.
I’d give the teeth out of my head if anybody wanted
them. It’s not in my nature to keep things for myself
when other people ought to have them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>I gave up the Morris chair. Mrs. Bushey was
gushingly grateful.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him it was yours and how willingly you
gave it up,” she said, moving toward the door. Then
she stopped suddenly and looked at the center-table
lamp. “He’s a great reader, he tells me&mdash;French
fiction. He ought to have a lamp and there’s not one
to spare in either house.”</p>

<p>She looked encouragingly at me. I wanted the
lamp.</p>

<p>“Can’t he read by the gas?” I pleaded.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Mrs. Bushey, with a reproving
look, “can <i>you</i> read by the gas?”</p>

<p>Conquered by her irrefutable argument, I surrendered
the lamp. She was again grateful.</p>

<p>“It’s so agreeable, dealing with the right sort of
people,” she said, fastening the last button of her
coat. “All the others in the house are so selfish&mdash;wouldn’t
give up anything. But one doesn’t have to
ask you. You offer it at once.”</p>

<p>The count arrived yesterday afternoon, and we
are now fast friends. Our meeting fell out thus:&mdash; I
was reading and heard a sound of footsteps on the
stairs, footsteps going up and down, prowling restless
footsteps to which I paid no attention, as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>go on most of the time. Presently there was a knock
at my door and that, too, was a common happening,
as most things and people destined for our house find
refuge at my portal&mdash;intending lodgers for Mrs.
Bushey, the seedy man who has a bill for Mr. Hamilton,
the laundress with Mr. Hazard’s wash, the artist
who is searching for Miss Bliss and has forgotten
the address, the telegraph boy with everybody’s telegrams,
the postman with the special deliveries, and
Miss Harris’ purchases at the department stores.</p>

<p>I called, “Come in,” and the door opened, displaying
a thin, brown, dapper young man in a fur-lined
overcoat and a silk hat worn back from his forehead.
He had a smooth dark skin, a dash of hair on his
upper lip, and eyes so black in the pupil and white in
the eyeball that they looked as if made of enamel.</p>

<p>At the sight of a lady the young man took off his
hat and made a deep bow. When he rose from this
obeisance he was smiling pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I am Count Delcati,” he said.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” I responded, rising.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the count in careful English
with an accent. “I come to live here.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very nice place,” I answered.</p>

<p>“That is why I took the room,” said the count.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>“But now I am here I can’t get into it or find any
one who will open the door.”</p>

<p>He was locked out. Mrs. Bushey was absent imparting
the mysteries of physical culture and Emma,
the maid, was not to be found. In the lower hall was
a pile of luggage that might have belonged to an
actress touring in repertoire, and the count could
think of nothing better to do than sit on it till some
one came by and rescued him. Not at all sure that
he might not be a novel form of burglar, I invited
him into my parlor and set him by the register to
thaw out. He accepted my hospitality serenely,
pushing an armchair to the heat, and asking me if I
objected to his wrapping himself in my Navajo
blanket.</p>

<p>“How fortunate that I knocked at your door,” he
said, arranging the blanket. “Otherwise I should
surely be froze.”</p>

<p>I had an engagement at the dentist’s and disappeared
to put on my things. When I came back he
rose quickly to his feet, the blanket draped around
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I am going out,” I said. “I have to&mdash;it’s the
dentist’s.”</p>

<p>“Poor lady,” he murmured politely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“But&mdash;but you,” I stammered; “what will you
do while I’m gone?”</p>

<p>Holding the blanket together with one hand he
made a sweeping gesture round the room with the
other.</p>

<p>“Stay here till you come back.”</p>

<p>I thought of Roger or Betty chancing to drop in
and looked on the ground hesitant. There was a
slight pause; I raised my eyes. The count, clasping
the two ends of the blanket together over his breast,
was regarding me with mild attention.</p>

<p>“But if any of my friends come in to see me?”</p>

<p>“I will receive them&mdash;<i>varri</i> nicely,” said the
count.</p>

<p>We looked at each other for a solemn second and
then burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“All right,” I said. “There are the books and
magazines, there are the cigarettes, the matches are
in that Japanese box and that cut glass bowl is full
of chocolates.”</p>

<p>I left him and was gone till dark. At six I came
back to find the room illuminated by every gas-jet
and lamp and the count still there. He had quite a
glad welcoming air, as if I might have been his
mother or his maiden aunt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>
<p>“You here still,” I cried in the open doorway.</p>

<p>He gave one of his deep deliberate bows.</p>

<p>“I have been varri comfortable and warm,” he
designated the center table with an expressive gesture,
“I read magazines, I eat candy and I smoke&mdash;yes”&mdash;he
looked with a proud air into the empty
box&mdash;“yes, I smoke <i>all</i> the cigarettes.”</p>

<p>Then we went into the next house to find Mrs.
Bushey.</p>

<p>My supper&mdash;eggs and cocoa&mdash;is cooked by me in
the kitchenette. It is eaten in the dining-room or
bedroom (the name of the apartment varies with the
hour of the day) on one end of the table. The effect
is prim and spinsterly&mdash;a tray cloth set with china
and silver, a student lamp, and in the middle of the
table, a small bunch of flowers. People send them
sometimes and in the gaps when no one “bunches”
me I buy them. To keep human every woman should
have one extravagance.</p>

<p>I was breaking the first egg when a knock came
on the door, and Miss Harris entered. She came in
quickly, the gray fur coat over her arm, a bare hand
clasping gloves, purse and a theater bag, all of which
she cast on the divan-bed, revealing herself gowned
in black velvet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Good evening, dearie,” she said, patting at her
skirt with a preoccupied air, “would you mind doing
me a service?”</p>

<p>I rose uneasily expectant. I should not have been
surprised if she had asked for anything from one of
my eggs to all my savings.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so frightened,” she said, and wheeled
round disclosing the back of her dress gaping over
lingerie effects: “Hook me up, that’s all.”</p>

<p>As I began the service Miss Harris stood gracefully
at ease, throwing remarks over her shoulder:</p>

<p>“It’s a great blessing having you here, not alone
for your sweet little self,” she turned her head and
tried to look at me, pulling the dress out of my hands,
“but because before you came I had such a tragic
time with the three middle hooks.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?”</p>

<p>“Went unhooked sometimes and at others walked
up and down the stairs hoping I’d find one of the
inhabitants here, or a tramp, or the postman. He’s
done it twice for me&mdash;a very obliging man.”</p>

<p>I did not approve, but did not like to say so.</p>

<p>“There’s an eye gone here.”</p>

<p>“Only one,” said Miss Harris in a tone of surprise,
“I thought there were two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“Shall I pin it?”</p>

<p>“Please don’t. How could I get out a pin by myself,
and I won’t wake you up at midnight.”</p>

<p>“But it gaps and shows your neck.”</p>

<p>“Then if the play’s dull, the person behind me will
have something interesting to look at.”</p>

<p>“But really, Miss Harris&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My dear, good, kind friend, don’t be so proper,
or do be proper about yourself if it’s your nature and
you can’t help it, but don’t be about me. When I’m
on the stage I’ll have to show much more than my
neck, so I may as well get used to it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Harris!” I said in a firm cold tone, and
stopped the hooking.</p>

<p>I caught the gleam of a humorous gray eye.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Drake!” She whirled round and put her
hands on my shoulders and looked into my face with
a sweetness that was quite bewitching. “You dear
little mouse, don’t you know you’re one kind and
I’m another. Both are nice kinds in their way, so
don’t let’s try to mix them up.”</p>

<p>There is something disarmingly winning about
this woman. I think for the first time in my life I
have met a siren. I pulled my shoulders from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>grasp of her hands, as I felt myself pulling my spirit
from the grasp of her attraction.</p>

<p>“I’ve not finished your dress,” I said.</p>

<p>She turned her back to me and gave a sigh.</p>

<p>“Go on, Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi,” she
said, and then added: “Are you the mother of anything?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” she murmured, “you ought to be.”</p>

<p>I didn’t reply to that. In the moment of silence
the sound of feet on the stairs was audible. They
came up the passage and began the ascent of the
next flight. Miss Harris started.</p>

<p>“That’s my man, I guess,” she said quickly and
tore herself from my hands.</p>

<p>She ran to the door and flung it open. I could
see the man’s feet and legs half-way up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Jack,” she cried in a joyous voice, “I’m here, in
Mrs. Drake’s room. Come down;” then to me: “It’s
Mr. Masters. I’m going to the theater with him.”</p>

<p>The feet descended and Mr. Masters came into
view. He was the man Roger and I had seen in the
passage.</p>

<p>He took Miss Harris’ proffered hand, then sent a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>look at me and my room that contained a subtle suggestion
of rudeness, of bold and insolent intrusion.
Before she could introduce us he bowed and said
easily:</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mrs. Drake. Saw you the other
night in the hall.”</p>

<p>I inclined my head very slightly. His manner and
voice increased my original dislike. I felt that I
could not talk to him and turned to Miss Harris.
Something in her face struck me unpleasantly. Her
look was bent upon him and her air of beaming upon
the world in general was intensified by a sort of special
beam&mdash;an enveloping, deeply glowing beam,
such as mothers direct upon beloved children and
women upon their lovers.</p>

<p>The door was open and Mr. Masters leaned upon
the door-post.</p>

<p>“Nice little place you’ve got here,” he said. “Better
than yours, Lizzie.”</p>

<p>Miss Harris withdrew her glance from him, it
seemed to me with an effort, as if it clung upon him
and she had to pluck it away.</p>

<p>“Finish me,” she said, turning abruptly to me, “I
must go.”</p>

<p>All the especial glow for me was gone. Her eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>lit on mine vacant and unseeing. I suddenly seemed
to have receded to a point on her horizon where I
had no more personality than a dot on a map. I
was not even a servant, simply a pair of hands that
prepared her for her flight into the night with the
vulgar and repulsive man. This made me hesitate,
also I didn’t want to go on with the hooking while
Mr. Masters leaned against the door-post with that
impudently familiar air.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Masters will go into the passage,” I said.</p>

<p>He laughed good-humoredly, but did not budge.
Miss Harris made a movement that might easily
have degenerated into an angry stamp.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be such an old maid,” she said petulantly.
“Do the collar and let me go.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t refuse, but I went on with the hooking
with a flushed face. What a fool I had been not to
take Betty’s advice. Charming as she could be when
she wanted, Miss Harris was evidently not a person
whose manners remained at an even level.</p>

<p>“Have you heard Miss Harris sing?” asked Mr.
Masters.</p>

<p>“Yes, through the register.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bad conductor. You must come up and
hear her in her own rooms some evening.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“If Miss Harris wants me to.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Drake will some day hear me sing in the
Metropolitan,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“Some day,” responded Mr. Masters.</p>

<p>There was something in his enunciation of this
single word, so acid, so impregnated with a sneering
quality that I stopped my work and cast a surprised
glance at him.</p>

<p>He met it with a slight smile.</p>

<p>“Our friend Lizzie here,” he said, “has dreams&mdash;what
I’m beginning to think are pipe dreams.”</p>

<p>“Jack,” she cried with a sudden note of pleading,
“you know that’s not true. You <i>know</i> I’ll some day
sing there.”</p>

<p>“I know you want to,” he replied, then with the
air of ignoring her and addressing himself exclusively
to me: “Miss Harris has a good voice, I
might say a fine voice. But&mdash;all here,” he spread his
fingers fan-wise across his forehead and tapped on
that broad expanse, “the soul, the thing that sees
and feels&mdash;absent, nil,” he fluttered the spread fingers
in the air.</p>

<p>I was astounded at his cruel frankness&mdash;all the
more so as I saw it had completely dashed her spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Rubbish, I don’t believe a word of it,” I answered
hotly, entirely forgetting that I was angry with her.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” he returned coolly, “I’ve told her so
often. A great presence, a fine mechanism,” he swept
her with a gesture as if she had been a statue, “but
the big thing, the heart of it all&mdash;not there. No
imagination, no temperament, just a well regulated,
handsomely decorated musical box. Isn’t that so,
Lizzie?”</p>

<p>He turned from me and directly addressed her,
his eyes narrowed, his face showing a faint sardonic
amusement. I wondered what she was going
to say&mdash;whether she would fly at him, or whether,
like the woman I knew, she would hide her mortification
and refuse him the satisfaction of seeing how
he hurt her.</p>

<p>She did neither. Moving to the divan, she picked
up her coat, showing me a face as dejected as that
of a disappointed child. His words seemed to have
stricken all the buoyancy out of her and she
shrugged herself into the coat with slow fatigued
movements. Bending to pick up her gloves and
glasses she said somberly:</p>

<p>“I’ll get a soul some day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“We hope so,” he returned.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know anything about it,” I said in
an effort to console.</p>

<p>“Oh, doesn’t he!” she answered bitterly. “It’s his
business.”</p>

<p>“I’m a speculator in voices,” he said, “and our
handsome friend Lizzie here has been an investment
that, I’m beginning to fear, won’t pay any dividends.”</p>

<p>He laughed and looked at her with what seemed
to me a quite satanic pleasure in his tormenting.</p>

<p>I could think of nothing to say, bewildered by the
strange pair. Miss Harris had gathered up her belongings
and moved to the door with a spiritless
step.</p>

<p>“Good night,” she said, glancing at me as if I was
a chair that had temporarily supported her weight in
a trying moment.</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Mr. Masters cheerfully.
“Some day go up and hear Lizzie sing and see if
you can find the soul in the sound.”</p>

<p>He gave a wave with his hat and followed her
down the hall.</p>

<p>I shut the door, and am not ashamed to confess,
leaned upon it listening. I wanted to hear her attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
him on the lower flight. But their footsteps
died away in silence.</p>

<p>I cleared away my supper, sunk in deep reflections.
What an extraordinary woman! One moment treating
you like her bosom friend, the next oblivious of
your existence, and most extraordinary of all, meekly
enduring the taunts of that unspeakable man. I
couldn’t account for it in any way except that she
must be going to marry him&mdash;and that was a hateful
thought. For if she <i>was</i> rude, and had the manners
of a spoiled child, there was something about her
that drew you close, as if her hands had hold of
yours and were pulling you softly and surely into
her embrace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">R</span>oger</span> and I went out to dinner last night,
down-town to our favorite haunt in University
Place.</p>

<p>I put on my best, a brown velveteen princesse
gown (one of Betty’s made over), my brown hat
with the gold rose and my amber beads. I even
powdered my nose, which I was brought up to think
an act of depravity only perpetrated by the lost and
fallen. When I am dressed up I really do not look
thirty-three. But I’ll have to buy two little rats to
puff out my hair at the sides. It’s too flat under that
hat. Roger was pleased when he saw me&mdash;that’s
why I did it. What’s the fun of dressing for yourself?
Some one must look at you admiringly and say,
well, whatever it’s his nature to say. I suppose Mr.
Masters would exclaim, “Gee, you’re a peach!”
Roger said, “I like you in brown.”</p>

<p>I love going down Fifth Avenue in the dark of a
winter evening. The traffic of business is over.
Motors and carriages go spinning by, carrying people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
to dinners. The big glistening street is like an
artery with the joyous blood of the city racing
through it, coursing along with the throb, throb,
throb of a deathless vitality. And the lights&mdash;the
wonderful, glowing, golden lights! Two long lines
of them on either side that go undulating away into
the distance, and broken ones that flash by in a yellow
streak, and round glaring ones like the alarmed
eyes of animals rushing toward you in terror.</p>

<p>And I love the noise, the near-by rumble and clatter,
and outside it the low continuous roar, the voice
of the city booming out into the quiet of the fields
and up into the silence of the skies. One great, unbroken
sound made up of millions of little separate
sounds, one great consolidated life made up of millions
of little separate life, each of such vital importance
to the one who’s living it.</p>

<p>We had lots to talk about, Roger and I. We
always do. We might be wrecked on a desert island
and go on talking for ten years without coming to
the end. There are endless subjects&mdash;the books we
read, the plays we see, pictures over which we argue,
music of which I know nothing, and people, the
most absorbing of all, probably because gossiping is
a reprehensible practise. There is nothing I enjoy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>more. If I hadn’t been so well brought up I would
be like the women in the first act of <i>The School
for Scandal</i>. Sometimes we make little retrospective
journeys into the past. But we do this
cautiously. There are five years we neither of us
care to touch on, so we talk forward by preference.</p>

<p>Of course I had to tell Roger of Miss Harris and
Mr. Masters. It lasted through two courses.</p>

<p>“What a dog!” was Roger’s comment.</p>

<p>“Roger,” I said earnestly, “do you think she could
be in love with such a man?”</p>

<p>Roger shrugged.</p>

<p>“How can <i>I</i> tell?”</p>

<p>“But could any woman&mdash;any possible kind of a
woman? And she’s a very possible kind. Something
comes from her and finds your heart and draws it
right out toward her. She couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t understand this enigmatical
lady.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I don’t understand everything about
her, I’ve only known her a few days. But I can
feel&mdash;it’s an instinct&mdash;that underneath where the
real things are she’s true and sound.”</p>

<p>I can see into Roger more clearly than he knows,
and I saw that he wasn’t at all interested in Miss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>Harris. He looked round the room and said indifferently:</p>

<p>“Why does she have a cad like that hanging
about?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps underneath there’s something fine in
him.”</p>

<p>“Very far underneath, buried so deep nobody but
Miss Harris can find it.”</p>

<p>“Roger, don’t be disagreeable. You’ve never seen
either of them.”</p>

<p>“Evie, dear, your descriptions are very graphic.
Do you know what I think?” He looked at me,
smiling a little, but with grave eyes. “I think that
you’re seeing Miss Harris through yourself. You’re
putting your brain into her head and your heart
into her body and then trying to explain her. That’s
what’s making her such a puzzle.”</p>

<p>The waiter here produced a casserole with two
squabs in it and presented it to Roger’s gaze as if
it were a gift he was humbly offering. Roger looked
at it and waved him away as if the gift was not
satisfactory.</p>

<p>“They look lovely,” I called, and Roger smiled.</p>

<p>The squabs occupied him and my thoughts occupied
me finally to find expression in a question:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>
<p>“Roger, what is a gentleman?”</p>

<p>He looked surprised.</p>

<p>“A gentleman? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I say&mdash;what is it?”</p>

<p>“You know.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. That’s just the point. There are lots
of things that everybody&mdash;young people and fools&mdash;seem
to understand and I don’t. One is the theory
of vicarious atonement, one is why girls are educated
to know nothing about marriage and children,
which are the things that most concern them, and
one is what makes a man a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Roger considered:</p>

<p>“Let’s see&mdash;at a blow. A gentleman is a man who
observes certain rules of behavior founded on consideration
for the welfare and comfort of others.”</p>

<p>“It sounds like the polite letter writer. Can a
gentleman tell lies?”</p>

<p>“To benefit himself, no. To shield others, yes.”</p>

<p>“If he was noble inside&mdash;in his character&mdash;and
uncouth outside, would he be a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by uncouth?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;wore a watch chain made of nuggets like
a man I met in Dresden, and ate peas with his
knife?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>
<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, if he had beautiful manners and a bad
heart, would he be one?”</p>

<p>“If his bad heart didn’t obtrude too much on his
dealings with society, he might.”</p>

<p>“Is it all a question of clothes and manners?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to have besides the clothes and manners
an inner instinct?”</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>I mused for a moment, then, looking up, caught
Roger’s eye fixed on me with a quizzical gleam.</p>

<p>“Why this catechism?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of Mr. Masters.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” said Roger crossly, his gleam
suddenly extinguished. “Can’t you get away from
the riff-raff in that house? I wish you’d never gone
there.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. I was wondering if Mr. Masters,
under that awful exterior had a fine nature, could
he possibly be a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Evie,” said Roger, putting down his knife and
fork and looking serious, “if under that awful exterior
Mr. Masters had the noble qualities of George
Washington, Sir Philip Sidney and the Chevalier
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>Bayard he could no more be a gentleman than I
could be king of Spain.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid that’s what you’d say.” I sighed
and returned to my squab.</p>

<p>I said no more about it, but when I got home my
thoughts went back to it. I hated to think of Lizzie
Harris in the company of such a man. If she was
lacking in judgment and worldly knowledge some
one ought to supply them for her. She was alone
and a stranger. Mrs. Bushey had told me she came
from California, and from what I’d heard, California’s
golden lads and lassies scorned the craven
deference to public opinion that obtains in the effete
East. But she was in the effete East, and she must
conform to its standards. She probably had never
given them a thought and had no initiated guide to
draw them to her attention. Whatever Betty might
say, I was free to be friendly with whomever I
pleased. That was one of the few advantages of
being a widow, <i>déracinée</i> by four years in Europe.
By the morning I had decided to put my age and
experience at her service and this afternoon went
up-stairs to begin doing it.</p>

<p>She was in her front room, sitting at a desk writing.
A kimono of a bright blue crêpe enwrapped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>her, her dark hair, cloudy about the brows, was
knotted loosely on the nape of her neck. She rose
impulsively when she saw me, kissed me as if I was
her dearest friend, then motioned me to the sofa,
and went back to her place at the desk.</p>

<p>The room is like mine, only being in the mansard,
the windows are smaller and have shelf-like sills.
It was an odd place, handsome things and tawdry
things side by side. In one corner stood a really
beautiful cabinet of red Japanese lacquer, and beside
it a three-legged wooden stool, painted white
with bows of ribbon tied round each leg as if it was
some kind of deformed household pet. Portions of
Miss Harris’ wardrobe lay over the chairs, and the
big black hat crowned the piano tool. On the window-sill,
drooping and withered, stood a clump of
cyclamen in a pot, wrapped in crimped green paper.
Beside it was a plate of crackers and a paper bag,
from whose yawning mouth a stream of oranges had
run out, lodging in corners. The upright piano, its
top covered with stacked music, the wintry light
gleaming on its keys, stood across a rear angle of
the room and gave the unkempt place an air of purpose,
lent it a meaning.</p>

<p>It must be confessed Miss Harris did not look as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>if she needed assistance or advice. She was serene
and debonair and the blue kimono was extravagantly
becoming. I sat down upon the sofa against a pile
of cushions. The bottom ones were of an astonishing
hardness which obtruded through the softness of
the top ones as if an eider-down quilt had been
spread over a pile of bricks. I tried to look as if I
hadn’t felt the bricks and smiled at Miss Harris.</p>

<p>“See what I’ve been doing,” she said, and handed
me a sheet of note paper upon which were inscribed
a list of names.</p>

<p>I looked over them and they recalled to my mind
the heroines of G. P. R. James’ novels of which, in
my teens, I had been fond.</p>

<p>“Suggestions for my stage name,” she explained.
“How does number three strike you?”</p>

<p>Number three was Leonora Bronzino.</p>

<p>“That’s an Italian painter,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Is it? What a bother. Would he make a fuss?”</p>

<p>“He’s been dead for several hundred years.”</p>

<p>“Then he doesn’t matter. What do you think of
number five?”</p>

<p>I looked up number five&mdash;Liza Bonaventura.</p>

<p>I murmured it, testing the sound. Miss Harris
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>eyed me with attention, rapping gently on her teeth
with the pen handle.</p>

<p>“Is it too long?”</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure.</p>

<p>“Of course when I got to be famous it would be
just Bonaventura. And that’s a good word&mdash;might
bring me luck.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you use your own name?”</p>

<p>She laughed, throwing back her head so that I
could see the inside of her mouth, pink and fresh like
a healthy kitten’s.</p>

<p>“Lizzie Harris on a program&mdash;never!” Then
suddenly serious, “I like Bonaventura&mdash;‘Did you
<i>hear</i> Bonaventura last night in <i>Tannhäuser</i>’&mdash;strong
accent on the hear. ‘How superb Bonaventura was
in <i>Carmen</i>.’ It has a good ring. And then I’ve got
a little dribble of Spanish blood in me.”</p>

<p>“You look Spanish.”</p>

<p>She nodded:</p>

<p>“My grandmother. She was a Spanish Californian&mdash;Estradilla.
They owned the Santa Caterina
Rancho near San Luis Obispo. My grandfather was
a sailor on a Yankee ship that used to touch there
and get hides and tallow. He deserted and married
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>her and got with her a strip of the rancho as big as
Long Island. And their illustrious descendant lives
in two rooms and a kitchenette.”</p>

<p>She laughed and jumped up.</p>

<p>“I’m going to sing for you and you’ll see if Bonaventura
doesn’t go well with my style.”</p>

<p>She swept the hat off the piano stool and seated
herself. The walls of the room are covered with an
umber brown burlap which made an admirable background
for her long body clothed in the rich sinuous
crêpe and her pale profile uplifted on an outstretched
white neck.</p>

<p>“I’ll sing you something that I do rather well&mdash;Elizabeth’s
going to be one of my great rôles,” she
said, and struck a chord.</p>

<p>It was <i>Dich Theure Halle</i> and she sang it badly.
I don’t mean that she flatted or breathed in the
wrong place, but she sang without feeling, or even
intelligence. Also her voice was not especially remarkable.
It was full, but coarse and hard, and
rolled round in the small room with the effect of
some large unwieldly thing, trying to find its way
out. What struck me as most curious was that the
rich and noble quality one felt in her was completely
lacking in her performance. It was commonplace,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>undistinguished. No matter how objectionable Mr.
Masters might be I could not but feel he was right.</p>

<p>When she had finished she wheeled suddenly
round on the stool and said quickly:</p>

<p>“Let me see your face.”</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s a fine voice,” I faltered, “so full and&mdash;er&mdash;rich.”</p>

<p>She paid no attention to my words, but sent a
piercing look over my embarrassed countenance.
Her own clouded and she drew back as if I had
hurt her.</p>

<p>“You don’t like it,” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that&mdash;what nonsense. Haven’t
I just said&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, keep quiet,” she interrupted roughly, and
giving the piano stool a jerk was twirled away from
me into a profile position. She looked so gloomy
that I was afraid to speak.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, during which I felt
exceedingly uncomfortable and she sat with her head
bowed, staring at the floor. Then she gave a deep
sigh and murmured.</p>

<p>“It’s so crushing&mdash;you all look the same.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Everybody who knows. And I’ve worked so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>hard and I’m eaten up,” she struck her breast with
her clenched fist, “eaten up in here with the longing
to succeed.”</p>

<p>The gesture was magnificent, and with the frowning
brows and somber expression she was the Tragic
Muse. If she could only get <i>that</i> into her voice!</p>

<p>“I’ve been at it two years, with Vignorol&mdash;you
know him? I’ve learnt Italian and German, and
nearly all the great mezzo rôles. And the polite ones
say what you say, and the ones who don’t care about
your feelings say ‘A good enough voice, but no
temperament.’” She gave her body a vicious jerk
and the stool twirled her round to me. “How in
heaven’s name can I get temperament?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;er&mdash;time&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;experience and sorrow&mdash;”
I had come up-stairs to give advice, but not
on the best manner of acquiring temperament.</p>

<p>She cut me short.</p>

<p class="p2b">“I’ve had experience, barrels of it. And time?
I’m twenty-six now&mdash;am I to wait till I’m seventy?
And sorrow? All my relations are dead&mdash;not that
I care much, most of them I didn’t know and those
I did I didn’t like. Shall I go and stand on the corner
of Forty-second Street and Broadway and
clamor for sorrow?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<p class="caption">“How in heaven’s name can I get temperament?”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“It’ll come without clamoring,” I said. Upon that
subject I can speak with some authority.</p>

<p>“I wish it would hurry up. I want to arrive, I
want to be a great prima donna. I <i>will</i> be a great
prima donna. I <i>will</i> sing into that big dark auditorium
and see those thousands of faces staring up at
me and make those thousands of dull fat pigs of
people sit up and come to life.”</p>

<p>She rose and walked to the window, pushed it up
and picking up one of the oranges, threw it out.</p>

<p>“I hope that’ll hit some one on the head,” she
said, banging the window down.</p>

<p>“Have you had the public’s opinion on your singing?”
I asked, feeling it best to ignore her eccentricities
of temper.</p>

<p>“Yes. I was in a concert in Philadelphia a year
ago, with some others.”</p>

<p>“And what was the verdict?”</p>

<p>She gave a bitter smile.</p>

<p>“The critics who knew something and took themselves
seriously, said ‘A large coarse voice and no
temperament.’ The critics who were just men said
nothing about the singing and a good deal about the
singer’s looks&mdash;” She paused, then added with sulky
passion, “Damn my looks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>She was going to the window again and I hastily
interposed.</p>

<p>“Don’t throw out any more oranges. You might
hit a baby lying in its carriage and break its nose.”</p>

<p>Though she did not give any evidence of having
heard, she wheeled from the window and turned
back to me.</p>

<p>“It’s been nothing but disappointments&mdash;sickening
disappointments. I wish I’d been left where I
was. Three years ago in California I was living in
a little town on the line between Los Angeles and
San Francisco. I sang in the church and got ambitious
and went up to San Francisco. They made a
good deal of fuss over me&mdash;said another big singer
was going to come out of California. I was just beginning
to wonder if I really <i>was</i> some one, when
one of those scratch little opera companies that tour
South America and Mexico came up. Masters, Jack&mdash;the
man you met here the other night&mdash;was managing
it. I got an introduction and sang for him,
and you ought to have heard him go up in the air.
Bang&mdash;pouf!&mdash;like dynamite! Not the way he is
now&mdash;oh, no&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped. The memory of those days of encouragement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
and promise seemed to shut off her
voice. She stared out of the window as if she were
looking back at them, her face set in an expression
of brooding pain. I thought she was going to cry,
but when she spoke her voice showed an angry petulance
far from the mood of tears.</p>

<p>“I’d never have got such big ideas if he hadn’t
given them to me. I must come on here and study,
not waste myself on little towns and little people.
Go for the big prize&mdash;that was what <i>I</i> was made for.”
She suddenly turned on me and flung out what
seemed the bitterest of her grievance, “He made me
do it. <i>He</i> insisted on my coming&mdash;got Vignorol to
take me, paid for my lessons. It’s his doing, all this.”</p>

<p>So <i>that</i> was the situation. That explained it all.
I was immensely relieved. She might be in love with
him, but if he was not in love with her (and he certainly
gave no evidences of it), it would be easy to
get rid of him. He was frankly discouraged about
her, would probably hail with relief any means of
escaping the continued expense of her lessons. The
instinct that had brought me up-stairs <i>was</i> a good
one after all.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you”&mdash;I felt my way carefully for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>ground was delicate&mdash;“couldn’t you put yourself in
some one else’s hands. Get some one else to&mdash;I don’t
know what the word is&mdash;”</p>

<p>She eyed me with an intent watching look that
was disconcerting.</p>

<p>“Be my backer?” she suggested.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“No, I could not,” she said, in a loud violent
tone. “Go back on the man who tried to make me,
dragged me out of obscurity and gave me my
chance? Umph!” She turned away with a scornful
movement: “That would be a great thing to do.”</p>

<p>The change was so quick that it bewildered me.
The cudgel with which she had been beating Masters
was now wielded in his defense. The ground was
even more delicate than I had thought, and silence
was wisdom till I saw what was coming next. I rose
from the rocky cushions and moved to the window.</p>

<p>The light in the little room had grown dim, the
keys of the piano gleaming whitely from their dusky
corner. With a deep sigh Miss Harris walked to the
sofa, threw herself full length on it and lay still, a
tall dark shape looking up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>I did not know what to say and yet I did not like
to leave her so obviously wretched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Shall I light the gas?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” came the answer, “I like the dark.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I water the cyclamen? They’re
dying.”</p>

<p>“I do. I want them to die.”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands under her head and continued
to gaze at the ceiling. I moved to the door
and then paused.</p>

<p>“Can I do anything for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;” she shifted her glance and looked at me
from beneath lowered lids. I again received the impression
I had had the evening when I hooked her
dress&mdash;that I was suddenly removed to an illimitable
distance from her, had diminished to an undecipherable
speck on her horizon. Never before had I met
anybody who could so suddenly and so effectively
strike from me my sense of value and importance.</p>

<p>“You can do something I’d like very much&mdash;go,”
the voice was like a breath from the arctic.</p>

<p>I went, more amazed than angry. On the landing
I stood wondering. What had I done to her? If I
hadn’t been so filled up with astonishment I might
have laughed at the contrast between my recent satisfaction
in my mission and my inglorious dismissal.</p>

<p>My thoughts were dispersed by voices from below,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>resounding up through the cleft of the stairs. From
a background of concerted sound, a series of short
staccato phrases detached themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My ’at! Look at it! Ruined! Smashed!”</p>

<p>I looked over the banister. On the floor below
stood the count addressing Miss Bliss, Mr. Hamilton,
Mr. Hazard and Mr. Weatherby, who stood
ranged in their hallway in a single line, staring up
at him. In one extended arm he held out a silk hat
in a condition of collapse. Their four upturned faces
were solemn and intent. Miss Bliss’ mouth was
slightly open, Mr. Hamilton’s glasses glittered.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” I called, beginning to descend.</p>

<p>The count lifted a wrathful visage and shook the
hat at me.</p>

<p>“Look at my ’at.”</p>

<p>A chorus rose from the floor below:</p>

<p>“Some one smashed his hat.”</p>

<p>“Threw an orange on it.”</p>

<p>“He says it came from here.”</p>

<p>“I think he’s wrong. It must have been the next
house.”</p>

<p>“It was not,” cried the count, furious. “It was
’ere&mdash;<i>this</i> ’ouse. I am about to enter and crash&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>falls on me! From there&mdash;above,” he waved the
hat menacingly at the top floor.</p>

<p>The quartet below chorused with rising hope.</p>

<p>“Who’s up there, Mrs. Drake?”</p>

<p>“Did any one throw an orange?”</p>

<p>“Is Miss Harris at home?”</p>

<p>I approached the count, alarmed at his hysterical
Latin rage.</p>

<p>“Who has throw the orange?” he demanded, forgetting
his English in his excitement.</p>

<p>“You can have it reblocked,” I said comfortingly.</p>

<p>The count looked as if I had insulted him.</p>

<p>“’Ere?” he cried, pointing to the ground at his
feet as if a hatter and his block were sitting there.
“Never. I brought it from Italy.”</p>

<p>From below the voices persisted:</p>

<p>“Were you with Miss Harris?” This from Mr.
Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was.”</p>

<p>“Did she throw an orange?” This from Mr.
Hazard.</p>

<p>“Why should any one throw an orange out of a
front window?”</p>

<p>Miss Bliss answered that.</p>

<p>“She might. She’s a singer and they do queer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>things. I knew a singer once and she threw a clock
that wouldn’t go into a bathtub full of water.”</p>

<p>This seemed to convince the count of Miss Harris’
guilt.</p>

<p>“She did it. I must see ’er,” he cried, and tried to
get past me. I spread my arms across the passage.
If he and Miss Harris met in their several fiery
states of mind, there would be a riot on the top floor.</p>

<p>I don’t like to tell lies, but I remembered Roger
had said that a gentleman could lie to shield another.
Why not a lady? Besides, in this case, I would
shield two others, for I had no doubt if Count Delcati
intruded on Miss Harris he would be worsted. She
was quite capable of throwing the other oranges at
him and the three-legged stool.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly,” I said. “She didn’t throw it.”</p>

<p>The male portion of the lower floor chorused:</p>

<p>“I knew she didn’t.”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t have.”</p>

<p>“Why should she?”</p>

<p>The count, with maledictions on the country, the
city, the street and the house, entered his room, the
Westerners entered theirs and Mr. Hamilton ascended
to his. He puffed by me on the stairs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ridiculous to accuse a lovely woman like Miss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>Harris of such a thing. We ought to deport these
Italians. They’re a menace to the country.”</p>

<p>Miss Bliss alone lingered. She is a pretty, frowsy
little thing who looks cold and half fed, and always
wears a kimono jacket fastened at the neck with a
safety pin. She waited till all the doors had banged,
then looking up, hissed softly:</p>

<p>“She did it. I was looking out of my window and
saw it coming down and it couldn’t have come from
anywhere but her room.”</p>

<p>“Hush,” I said, leaning over the banister. “She
did. It’s the artistic temperament.”</p>

<p>Miss Bliss, as a model&mdash;artist not cloak&mdash;needed
no further explanation. With a low comprehending
murmur she stole into her room.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> count and Miss Harris have met and all
fear of battle is over. At the first encounter,
which took place in my sitting-room, it was obvious
that the young man was stricken. Since then he has
seen her twice and has fallen in love&mdash;at least he
says he has.</p>

<p>As soon as he felt sure of it he came in to tell me.
So he said the other evening, sitting in the steamer
chair Betty gave me to replace the one Mrs. Bushey
took.</p>

<p>“You are a woman of sympathy,” he said, lighting
his third cigarette, “and I knew you would understand.”</p>

<p>Numberless young men have told me of their love-affairs
and always were sure I would understand. I
think it’s because I listen so well.</p>

<p>I have a fire now. It was easier to buy coal than
argue with Mrs. Bushey. The count stretched his
legs toward it and smoked dreamily and I counted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>the cigarettes in the box. He smokes ten in an evening.</p>

<p>“She is most beautiful. I can find only one defect,”
he murmured, “she is not thin enough.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she?” I said, in my character of sympathetic
woman, “I thought she was rather too thin.”</p>

<p>“Not for me,” answered the lover pensively; “no
one could be too thin for me.”</p>

<p>He resumed his cigarette. It was nine and there
were seven left. I calculated that they would last
him till eleven.</p>

<p>“There was a lady in Rome I once knew,” he began
in a tone of reminiscence, “thin like a match and
so beautiful,” he extended his hand in the air, the
first finger and thumb pressed together as if he
might have been holding the match-like lady between
them, “a blonde with brown eyes, immense
eyes. Oh, <i>Dio mio!</i>” His voice trailed away into
silence, swamped by a flood of memory.</p>

<p>“Were you in love with her, too?” I have noticed
that the confiding young men expect the sympathetic
woman to ask leading questions.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the count gravely, “four years ago.”</p>

<p>“You must have been very young.”</p>

<p>Such remarks as this are out of character. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>take me unawares and come from the American part
of me&mdash;not the human universal part, but that which
is individual and local.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I was nineteen.” He went back to his
memories. “She was all bones, but such beautiful
bones. One winter she had a dress made of fur and
she looked like an umbrella in it. This way,” he
extended his hands and described two straight perpendicular
lines in the air, “the same size all the way
up. Wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Our young men don’t fall in love so early,” I
said.</p>

<p>“They don’t fall in love at all,” replied the count,
“neither do the women. They only flirt, all of them,
except Miss Harris.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t she flirt?”</p>

<p>I was stretching my sympathetic privileges a little
too far. My excuse is curiosity, vulgar but natural.
I had never before seen any one like Miss Harris
and I wanted to get at the heart of her mystery.</p>

<p>“Flirt!” exclaimed the count. “Does a goddess
flirt? That’s what she is. Think of it&mdash;in this new
shiny country, in this city with telephones and policemen,
in this sad street with the houses all built
the same.” He sat upright and shook his cigarette at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>me. “She belongs where it is all sunshine and joy,
and they dance and laugh and there is no business
and nobody has a conscience.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Ancient Greece or Modern
Naples?”</p>

<p>The count made a vague sweeping gesture that
left a little trail of smoke in the air.</p>

<p>“<i>N’importe!</i> But not here. She is a pagan, a
natural being, a nymph, a dryad. I don’t know what
in your language&mdash;but oh, something beautiful that
isn’t bothered with a soul.”</p>

<p>I started, Masters and the count, raw America
and sophisticated Italy, converging toward the same
point.</p>

<p>Before I could answer her voice sounded startlingly
loud through the register. For the first moment I
didn’t recognize the strain, then I knew it&mdash;“<i>Vissi
d’arte, vissi d’amore</i>”&mdash;I have lived for art, I have
lived for love. We looked at each other in surprised
question as the impassioned song poured from the
grating. It was as if she had heard us and this was
her answer.</p>

<p>My knowledge of nymphs and dryads is small,
but I feel confident if one of them had ever sung a
modern Italian aria through a modern American
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>register she could not have rendered it with less
heart and soul than Miss Harris did.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning Betty telephoned me to come
and lunch with her. Betty’s summons are not casual
outbreaks of hospitality. There is always an underlying
purpose in them, what a man I know who
writes plays would call “a basic idea”. She is one
of the few people who never troubles about meaningless
formalities or superfluous small talk. It’s her
way, and then she hasn’t time. That’s not just a
phrase but a fact. Every hour of her day has its
work, good work, well done. Only the poor know
Betty’s private charities, only her friends the number
of her businesslike benefactions.</p>

<p>Walking briskly down the avenue I wondered
what was her basic idea this time. Sometimes it’s
clothes: “There are some dresses on the bed. Look
them over and take what you like. The gray’s rather
good, but I think the pink would be more becoming.
I can have it done over for you by my woman.”
Sometimes it’s a reinvestment of part of my little
capital suggested by Harry, a high interest and
very safe. Once it was an attempt to marry me off.
That was last autumn when I had just got back from
Europe, to a man with mines from Idaho. When I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>grew tearful and reluctant she gave it up and shifted
him&mdash;for he was too valuable to lose&mdash;to a poor relation
of Harry’s.</p>

<p>We were at lunch when the basic idea began to
rise to the surface, Betty at the head of the table,
very tight and upright in purple cloth and chiffon,
and little Constance, her eldest born, opposite me.
Little Constance is an adorable child with a face like
a flower and the manner of a timid mouse. She loves
clothes and when I come leans against me looking
me over and gently fingering my jewelry. She
won’t speak until she has examined it to her satisfaction.
At the table her steadfast gaze was diverted
from me to a dish of glazed cherries just in front
of her.</p>

<p>The entrée was being passed when Betty, helping
herself, said:</p>

<p>“Harry’s just met a man from Georgia who is
in cotton&mdash;not done up in it, his business.” She
looked into the dish then accusingly up at the butler:
“I said fried, not boiled, and I didn’t want cream
sauce.”</p>

<p>The butler muttered explanations.</p>

<p>“Tell her it mustn’t happen again, no more cream
sauce for lunch.” She helped herself, murmuring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>“Really the most fattening thing one can eat.”</p>

<p>“Why do you eat it?” said little Constance, withdrawing
her eyes from the cherries.</p>

<p>“Because I like to. Keep quiet, Constance. Mr.
Albertson, that’s his name, is well-off, perfectly presentable
and a widower.”</p>

<p>So it was matrimonial again.</p>

<p>“That’s very nice,” I replied meekly.</p>

<p>“We’ll have him to dinner some night next week
and you to meet him.”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask me? He’d surely rather have
some one younger and prettier.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter what he’d rather have. I’ll
telephone you when the day’s fixed.”</p>

<p>“Betty,” I murmured, looking at her pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Evie,” she returned firmly, “don’t be silly. The
present situation’s got to come to an end some time.”</p>

<p>“It’ll never end.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish. There’s no sense in you scraping along
this way in two rooms&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Remember the kitchenette.”</p>

<p>“In two rooms,” she went on, ignoring the
kitchenette. “Of course I don’t want you to live in
Georgia, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>Little Constance showed a dismayed face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>
<p>“Is Evie going to live in Georgia?”</p>

<p>Betty turned a stern glance on her.</p>

<p>“Constance, you’ll lunch up-stairs if you keep on
interrupting.”</p>

<p>Constance was unaffected by the threat.</p>

<p>“When is she going?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Never,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said little Constance, and seeing her
mother’s glance averted, stole a cherry from the dish
and hid it in her lap.</p>

<p>“From what Harry says, and he’s heard all about
Mr. Albertson, he seems a perfectly fitting person,
forty-five, of very good family and connections, and
with an income of thirty thousand a year.”</p>

<p>“He’ll probably not like me,” I said hopefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, he will,” answered Betty with grim meaning,
“I’ll see to that.”</p>

<p>I could hear her retailing my perfections to Mr.
Albertson and my heart sank. Masterful, managing
people crush me. If the man from Georgia liked
me, as the man from Idaho did, I foresaw a struggle
and I seem to have exhausted all my combative force
in the year before my husband died. I looked at
little Constance and caught her in the act of popping
the cherry into her mouth. It was large and she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>to force it into her cheek and keep it there like a
squirrel with a nut. An expression of alarm was in
her face, there was evidently less room for it than
she had expected.</p>

<p>Betty went ruthlessly on.</p>

<p>“Your present way of living is absurd&mdash;you, made
for marriage.”</p>

<p>I saw little Constance’s eyes grow round with
curiosity, but she did not dare to speak.</p>

<p>“Made for companionship. If you were a suffragette
or a writer, or trimmed hats or ran a tea-room,
it would be different, but you’re a thoroughly
domestic woman and ought to have a home.”</p>

<p>Little Constance bit the cherry with a sharp
crunching sound. Betty looked at her.</p>

<p>“Constance, are you eating your lunch?”</p>

<p>Little Constance lifted her bib, held it to her
mouth, and nodded over it.</p>

<p>The danger was averted. Betty turned to me.</p>

<p>“Marriage is the only life for a normal woman.
Judkins, I’ll have some more of those sweetbreads.”</p>

<p>She helped herself, and under the rattle of the
spoon and fork, little Constance crunched again,
very carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“And what is the good of living in the past.
That’s over, thank heaven.”</p>

<p>“I’m not living in the past any more. Betty, I’m&mdash;I’m&mdash;raising
my head.”</p>

<p>Betty looked sharply up from the sweetbreads,
and I flinched under her glance. She cast an eye on
Judkins, who was receding into the pantry, waited
till he was gone, then said, in an eager hushed voice:</p>

<p>“Evie, don’t tell me there’s some one?”</p>

<p>Never have I been more discomfited by the directness
of my Betty. I felt myself growing red to
my new rat and was painfully aware that little Constance,
now crunching rapidly, had fixed upon me
the deadly stare of an interested child.</p>

<p>“Of course there isn’t. What nonsense. But time
has passed and one doesn’t stay broken-hearted forever.
I’m not <i>old</i> exactly, and I’m&mdash;that is&mdash;it’s
just as I said, I’m beginning to come alive again.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Betty breathed out and leaned against her
chair-back, with a slight creaking of tight drawn
fabrics. But she kept her eye on me, in a sidelong
glance, that contained an element of inspecting inquiry.
Little Constance swallowed the cherry at a
gulp and the question it had bottled up burst out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Evie, are you going to get married?”</p>

<p>“No,” I almost shouted.</p>

<p>Little Constance said no more, but her gaze remained
glued to my face in an absorption so intense
that she leaned forward, pressing her chest against
the edge of the table. Betty played with her knife
and fork with an air of deep thought. Judkins reentered
to my relief.</p>

<p>He was passing the next dish when little Constance
broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Evie, why did you get all red just now?”</p>

<p>“Constance,” said her mother, “if you’re a good
girl and stop talking you can have a cherry when
lunch is over.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, mama,” said little Constance, in her
most mouse-like manner.</p>

<p>After lunch we drove about in the auto and
shopped, and as the afternoon began to darken Betty
haled me to a reception.</p>

<p>“Madge Knowlton’s daughter’s coming out,” she
said. “And as you used to know her before you
went to Europe, it’s your duty to come.”</p>

<p>“Why is it my duty? I was never an intimate of
hers.”</p>

<p>I’m shy about going to parties now; I feel like
Rip Van Winkle when he comes back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“To swell the crowd. It’s a social service you owe
to a fellow woman in distress.”</p>

<p>We entered the house through a canvassed tunnel
and inserted ourselves into a room packed with
women and reverberating with a clamor of voices.
We had a word and a hurried handclasp with Madge
Knowlton and her daughter, and then were caught
in a surging mass of humanity and carried into a
room beyond. The jam was even closer here. I
dodged a long hatpin, and was borne back against a
mantelpiece banked with flowers whose delicate
dying breath mingled with the scents of food and
French perfumery. When the mass broke apart I
had momentary glimpses of a glittering table with
a woman at either end who was pouring liquid into
cups.</p>

<p>At intervals the crowd, governed by some unknown
law, was seized by migratory impulses. Segments
of it separated from the rest, and drove toward
the door. Here they met other entering segments
with a resultant congestion. When thus solidified
the only humans who seemed to have the key
of breaking us loose were waiters. They found their
way along the line of least resistance, making tortuous
passages like the cracks in an ice pack.</p>

<p>From them we snatched food. I had a glass of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>punch, a cup of coffee, a chocolate cake, two marrons
and a plate of lobster Neuberg, in the order
named. I haven’t the slightest idea why I ate them&mdash;suggestion
I suppose. All the other women were
similarly endangering their lives, and the one possible
explanation is that we communicated to one
another the same suicidal impulse. It was like the
early Christians going to the lions, the bold ones
swept the weaker along by the contagion of example.</p>

<p>I met several old acquaintances who cried as if
in rapturous delight.</p>

<p>“Why, Evelyn Drake, is this really you?”</p>

<p>“Evie&mdash;I can’t believe my eyes! I thought you
had gone to Europe and died there.”</p>

<p>“How delightful to see you again. Living out of
town, I suppose. We must arrange a meeting when
I get time.”</p>

<p>And so forth and so on.</p>

<p>It made me feel like a resurrected ghost who had
come to revisit the glimpses of the moon. My old
place was not vacant, it was filled up and the grass
was growing over it. I was glad when one of those
blind stampeding impulses seized the crowd and
carried me near enough to Betty to cry, as I was
borne along, “I’m going home and I’d rather walk,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>and was swept like a chip on a stream to the door.</p>

<p>It was raining, a thin icy drizzle. Beyond the
thronging line of limousines, the streets were dark
with patches of gilding where the lamplight struck
along the wet asphalt. They looked like streets in
dreams, mysteriously black gullies down which hurried
mysteriously black figures. I walked toward
Lexington Avenue, drooping and depressed, in accord
with the chill night and the small sad noises
of the rain. I was in that mood when you walk
slowly, knowing your best dress is getting damp and
feeling the moisture through your best shoes and
neither matters. Nothing matters.</p>

<p>Once I used to enjoy teas, found entertainment
in those brief shouted conversations, those perilous
feasts. Perhaps I was sad because I was so out of it
all. And what was I in&mdash;what took its place? I
was going back to emptiness and silence. To greet
me would be a voiceless darkness, my evening companion
a book.</p>

<p>I got on a car full of damp passengers. As if
beaten down by the relentless glare of the electric
lights, all the faces drooped forward, hollows under
the eyes, lines round the mouths. They sat in listless
poses, exhaling the smell of wet woolen and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>rubber and I sat among them, also exhaling damp
smells&mdash;also with hollows under my eyes and lines
round my mouth. That, too, didn’t matter. What
difference if I was hollowed and lined when there
was no one to care?</p>

<p>My room was unlighted and cold. I lighted the
gas and stood with uplifted hand surveying it. It
was like a hollow shell, an empty echoing shell, that
waited for a living presence to brighten it. Just then
it seemed to me as if I never could do this&mdash;its loneliness
would be as poignant and pervasive when I
was there, would steal upon me from the corners,
surround and overwhelm me like a rising sea. My
little possessions, my treasures, that were wont to
welcome me, had lost their friendly air. I suddenly
saw them as they really were, inanimate things
grasped and held close because associated with the
memory of a home. In the stillness the rain
drummed on the tin roof and the line in a forgotten
poem rose to my mind, “In the dead unhappy night
and when the rain is on the roof.”</p>

<p>I snatched a match and hurried to the fire. Thrusting
the flame between the bars of the grate, I said
to myself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“I must get some kind of a pet&mdash;a dog or a Persian
cat. I’ve not enough money to adopt a child.”</p>

<p>The fire sputtered and I crouched before it. I
didn’t want any supper, I didn’t want to move. I
think a long time passed, several hours, during
which I heard the clock ticking on the mantel over
my head, and the rain drumming on the roof. Now
and then the rumbling passage of a car swept across
the distance.</p>

<p>I have often sat this way and my thoughts have
always gone back to the past like homing pigeons
to the place where they once had a nest. To-night
they went forward. My married life seemed a great
way off, and the Evelyn Drake in it looked on by
the Evelyn Drake by the fire, a stranger long left
behind. The memories of it had lost their sting,
even the pang of disillusion was only a remembrance.
With my eyes on the leaping flames I looked over
the years that stretched away in front, diminishing
to a point like a railway track. My grandmother had
lived to eighty-two and I was supposed to be like
her. Would I, at eighty-two, be still a pair of ears
for young men’s love stories and young women’s
dreams of conquest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Oh, those years, that file of marching years, coming
so slowly and so inevitably, and empty, all
empty!</p>

<p>The rain drummed on the roof, the clock ticked
and the smell of my best skirt singeing, came delicately
to my nostrils. Even <i>that</i> didn’t matter. From
thirty-three to eighty-two&mdash;forty-nine years of it.
I looked down at my feet, side by side, smoking on
the fender. Wasn’t it Oliver Wendell Holmes,
when asked to define happiness, answered, “four
feet on the fender”?</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door, probably the
count to continue the recital of his love’s young
dream. My “Come in” was not warm.</p>

<p>The door opened and Roger entered in a long wet
raincoat.</p>

<p>I jumped up crying “Roger,” and ran to him with
my hand out.</p>

<p>He took it and held it, and for a moment we stood
looking at each other quite still and not speaking.
I was too glad to say anything, too glad to think.
It was an astonishing gladness, a sort of reaction I
suppose. It welled through me like a warm current,
must have shone in my face, and spoken from my
eyes. I’ve not often in my life been completely outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
myself, broken free of my consciousness and
soared, but I was then just for one minute, while I
looked into Roger’s face, and felt his hand round
mine.</p>

<p>“You’re glad to see me, Evie,” he said and his
voice sounded as if he had a cold.</p>

<p>That broke the spell. I came back to my eighteen-foot
parlor, but it was so different, cozy and pretty
and intimate, full of the things I care for and that
are friends to me. The rain on the roof had lost its
forlornness, or perhaps, by its forlornness accentuated
the comfort and cheer of my little room.</p>

<p>We sat by the fire. Roger’s feet were wet and he
put them upon the fender.</p>

<p>“Now, if you’d been plodding about in the rain
with me you’d put yours up, too. Hullo, what have I
said? Your face is as red as a peony.”</p>

<p>“It’s the fire. I’ve been sitting over it for a long
time,” I stammered.</p>

<p>Just then the register became vocal, with the
habanera from <i>Carmen</i>.</p>

<p>Roger got up and shut it.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to hear her sing?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, I want to hear you talk,” said he.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>iss Harris</span> is going to appear in a concert.
She came glowing and beaming into
my room to tell me. Vignorol, her teacher, had arranged
it&mdash;with a violinist and a baritone&mdash;in
Brooklyn.</p>

<p>“Why not New York?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not <i>yet</i>,” said Miss Harris, moving about the
room with a jubilant dancing step, “but after this
is over&mdash;wait and see!”</p>

<p>Great things are expected to come of it. The public’s
attention is to be caught, then another concert,
maybe an engagement in one of the American opera
companies&mdash;just for experience. It is to be the opening
of a career which will carry her to the Metropolitan
Opera House. The baritone is another of
Vignorol’s pupils, Berwick, a New Englander&mdash;nothing
much, just to fill up. The violinist is a Mrs.
Stregazzi, who also fills up, and little Miss Gorringe
accompanies. I was shown a pencil draft of the program
with Liza Bonaventura written large at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>top&mdash;“Yes, it’s to be Bonaventura; I had a superstition
about it,” and the dress is to be white, or, with
a sudden bright air:</p>

<p>“I might borrow your green satin&mdash;but of course
I couldn’t. You’re too small.”</p>

<p>Since then the house has resounded with practising
from the top floor. Heavy steps and light feminine
rustlings have gone up and down the stairs.
Once the strains of a violin came with a thin whine
through the register as if some melancholy animal
was imprisoned behind the grill. In the dusk of the
lower hall I bumped into a young man with tousled
hair and frogs on his coat, whom I have since met as
Mr. Berwick.</p>

<p>The star is in a state of joyful excitement which
has communicated itself to the rest of us. When in
the evening she goes over her repertoire, the Westerners
and Miss Bliss sit on the bottom steps of their
stairs, Mr. Hamilton and the count on the banisters
of theirs and I on the top step of mine. A Niagara
of sound pours over us, billowing and rushing down
through the well, buffeted between the close confining
walls. When each piece is ended Miss Harris
comes out on her landing, leans over the railing and
calls down:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>Then our six faces are upturned and we express
our approbation, according to our six different natures.</p>

<p>Our mutual hopes for her success have drawn us
together and we have suddenly become very friendly.
Mr. Hazard drops in upon me in a paint-stiffened
linen blouse and Mr. Weatherby has confided
to me the money to pay for his laundry. Mr. Hamilton
has smoked a large black cigar in my dining-room,
and Miss Bliss has come shivering with
hunched shoulders and clasped red arms to “borrow
a warm” (her own expression) at my fire.</p>

<p>In my excursions to the top floor I have met Mrs.
Stregazzi and Miss Gorringe. Mrs. Stregazzi is a
large blond lady with an ample figure and a confidential
habit. On our first meeting she called me
“dearie” and told me all about her divorce from Mr.
Stregazzi, who, I gathered, was her inferior, both in
station and the domestic virtues. In his profession&mdash;the
stage&mdash;he was something called “a headliner”,
and appeared to be involved mysteriously with
trained animals. Since his divorce he has married
another “headliner”. It’s like that story of the
Frenchman in Philadelphia: “He <i>is</i> a Biddle, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span><i>was</i> a Biddle, they are <i>both</i> Biddles.” I must ask
Lizzie Harris what it is. Miss Gorringe is a thin
sallow girl with an intelligent face, and Mr. Berwick
a bulky silent New Englander, in the early
twenties, who bears a strong resemblance to the bust
of Beethoven over Schirmer’s music store.</p>

<p>They are strange people, artless as children, and
completely absorbed in themselves and their work.
They appear to have no points of contact with any
other world, and the real part of their world is the
professional part. They don’t say much about their
homes or their lives away from it.</p>

<p>A few days ago they took tea with me, and as they
talked I had a series of glimpses, like quickly shifted
magic lantern slides, of their life on trains, in hotels,
behind the scenes and on the stage. It seemed to me
a sort of nightmare of hurry and scramble, snatched
meals, lost trunks, cold dressing-rooms. Maybe the
excitement makes up for the rest. It must be exciting&mdash;at
least that’s the impression I got as I sat
behind the teacups listening.</p>

<p>Lizzie Harris seemed to find it enthralling, everything
they said interested her. Mrs. Stregazzi told
some anecdotes that I didn’t like&mdash;I don’t want to
be a prig, but they really were <i>too</i> sordid and scandalous&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
our prima donna hung on the words of
that fat made-up woman as if she spoke with the
tongues of men and of angels. The more I know of
her the less able I am to get at the core of her being,
to place her definitely in my gallery of “women I
have known.” I had finally decided that in spite of
her tempests, her egotism and her weather-cock
moods, there was something rare and noble in her,
and here she was drinking in cheap gossip about a
set of people she didn’t know, and who seem to be a
mixture of artist, mountebank and badly brought-up
child.</p>

<p>As I sat pouring the tea I felt again that curious
aloofness in her. But before it was more a withdrawal
of her spirit into herself, a retreating into an
inner citadel and closing all the doors. This time it
was the spirit reaching toward others and shutting
me out, like a child who forgets its playmate when a
circus passes by. She listened hungrily, now and
then commenting or questioning with a longing, almost
a homesick note. When they rose to go, with a
scraping of chair-legs and a concerted clamor of
farewells, she was reluctant to lose them, followed
them to the hall and leaned over the banister
watching their departing heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>She made me feel an outsider, almost an intruder.
I was willing to efface myself for the moment and
stood by the table waiting for her to come back and
reestablish me in her regard. She said nothing,
however, but brushed by the door and went up-stairs.
In a few minutes Musetta’s song filled the house.
The next morning she came in while I was at breakfast
and asked me to lend my green satin dress to
Miss Gorringe, and when I agreed kissed me with
glowing affection.</p>

<p>That all happened early in the week. Yesterday
afternoon I was witness to a scene, the effect of
which is with me still, at midnight, scratching this
down in my rose-wreathed back room. It was a
hateful scene, a horrible scene&mdash;but let me describe it:</p>

<p>Calls of my name descending from the top floor
in Miss Harris’ voice, took me out to my door.</p>

<p>“I am going over some of my things,” the voice
cried. “Come up and listen.” Then, as I ascended,
“It’s the scene between Brunhilda and Siegmund in
<i>Die Walkuere</i>, the <i>piéce de résistance</i> of the evening.”</p>

<p>I didn’t find Miss Gorringe as I expected, but Mr.
Masters, sitting on the piano stool and looking glum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>He rose, nodded to me, and sinking back on the stool,
laid his hands on the keys and broke into a desultory
playing. With all my ignorance I have heard
enough to know that he played uncommonly well.</p>

<p>The future Signorita Bonaventura was looking
her best, a slight color in her cheeks, confidence
shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>“We’ve been trying it over. Did you hear?”</p>

<p>The weather had been warm, the register closed,
so I had only heard faintly.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s going to be something great,” said the
prima donna.</p>

<p>“Is it?” said Mr. Masters with his back to us.</p>

<p>The sneering quality was strong in his tone and I
began to wish I hadn’t come.</p>

<p>“Go across the room, Mrs. Drake,” he said curtly.
“Sit where you can see her.”</p>

<p>I obeyed, sitting in the corner by the window. She
faced me and Mr. Masters was in profile.</p>

<p>My friends tell me I am completely devoid of
the musical sense. It must be true, for I can not sit
through <i>Meistersinger</i>, and there are long reaches
of <i>Tristan and Isolde</i> that get on my nerves like a
toothache. But I <i>have</i> some kind of appreciation, do
derive an intense pleasure from certain scenes in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>certain operas. It was one of these scenes they were
now giving, that one in the second act of <i>Die
Walkuere</i> when Brunhilda appears before Siegmund.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that the drama rose
above the music, overpowered it. I supposed this to
be the fancy of my own ignorance and never had the
courage to say it. But the other day I read somewhere
the opinion of Dujardin, the French critic,
and he expressed just what I mean&mdash;“It is not the
music, no, it is not the music, that counts in the
scene, but the words. The music is beautiful&mdash;of
course it is, it couldn’t be otherwise&mdash;but Wagner
was aware of the beauty of the poetry and allowed
it to transpire.”</p>

<p>That is exactly what I should have said if I had
dared.</p>

<p>Masters struck the opening notes and she began
to sing.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Siegmund sieh’ auf mich! Ich bin’s der bald du folgst&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Siegmund, look on me. I come to call thee hence.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What a greeting!</p>

<p>A stir of irritation passed through me. She looked
at Masters with a friendly air and sang the lines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>with an absence of understanding and emotion that
would have robbed them of all meaning if anything
could. I wanted to shake her.</p>

<p>Then I forgot&mdash;Masters began.</p>

<p>If I was surprised at his playing his singing
amazed me. He had almost no voice, but he had all
the rest&mdash;the wonderful thing, imagination, the response
to beauty, power of representing a state of
mind. I don’t explain well, I am out of my province,
perhaps it’s better if I simply say he became Siegmund.</p>

<p>As he played he turned and looked at her. His
whole face had changed, transformed by the shadow
of tragedy. To him Lizzie was no longer Lizzie, she
was the helmed and armored daughter of Wotan delivering
his death summons. I can pay no higher
tribute to him than to say I forgot him, the burlap
walls, the thin tones of the piano and saw a vision
of despairing demigods.</p>

<p>My vision was dispelled. No one could have kept
it listening to her and watching her. As they went
on what he created she destroyed; it was the most
one-sided, maddening performance. I found myself
eager to have her stop that I might hear him. Before
they had reached the end I knew that Mr.
Masters was an artist and she was not. That is all
there was to it.</p>

<p>She turned to me, proudly smiling, with a questioning
“Well”.</p>

<p>Mr. Masters, his head drooped, heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>I could not be untruthful. I had been too deeply
moved.</p>

<p>“Your voice is very fine,” I said in the flattest
of voices and looked at her beseechingly.</p>

<p>She met my eyes steadily and her smile died
away.</p>

<p>“Only a voice,” she said.</p>

<p>“Miss Harris,” I cried imploringly. “You are
young, you have beauty&mdash;” She cut short my bromides
with an angry exclamation.</p>

<p>“And no more temperament than a tomato can,”
Mr. Masters finished for me.</p>

<p>He ran his fingers over the keyboard in a glittering
flow of notes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“You’re a liar,” she cried, turning furiously on
him.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, I saw her really angry,
not childishly petulant as in her orange-throwing
mood, but shaken to her depth with rage. She was
rather terrible, glaring at Masters with a grim face.</p>

<p>“Am I?” he said, coolly striking a chord. “We’ll
see Tuesday night in Brooklyn.”</p>

<p>I had expected him to answer her in kind, but he
only seemed weary and dispirited. Her chest rose
with a deep breath and I saw to my alarm that she
had grown paler.</p>

<p>“You didn’t always think that,” she said in a
muffled voice.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered quietly, “I believed in you
at first.”</p>

<p>He spread his hands in a long clutching movement
and struck another chord. It fell deep into the
momentary silence as if his powerful fingers were
driving it down like a clencher on his words.</p>

<p>“And you don’t any more?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve about done believing,” he responded.</p>

<p>She ran at him and seized him by the shoulder.
He jerked it roughly out of her grasp and twirling
round on the stool faced her, exasperated, defiant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>a man at the end of his patience. But his eyes said
more, full of a steely dislike. She met them and
panted:</p>

<p>“You can’t, you don’t. Even you couldn’t be so
mean&mdash;” then she stopped, it seemed to me as if for
the first time conscious of the hostility of his gaze.
There was the pause of the realizing moment and
when she burst out her voice was strangled with
passion:</p>

<p>“Go&mdash;get out&mdash;go away from me. I’m sick of it
all. I’ll stand no more&mdash;go&mdash;go.”</p>

<p>She ran to the door and threw it open. I got up
to make my escape. Neither of them appeared to remember
I was there.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, calmly rising. “That suits
me perfectly.”</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and coat and moved to the
door. I tried to get there before him, dodging about
behind their backs for an exit, then, like a frightened
chicken, made a nervous dive and got between
them. Her hand on my arm flung me back as if I
had been a chair in the way. I had a glimpse of
her full face, white and with burning eyes. She
frightened me.</p>

<p>Mr. Masters walked into the hall and there came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>to a standstill. After looking at the back and front
of his hat he settled it comfortably on his head
and moved toward the stairs.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rushed after him and caught him by
the arm.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;” she cried. “Don’t go.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t see her face, but his was in plain view
and it looked exceedingly bored.</p>

<p>“What is it now?” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. I’m so discouraged&mdash;you
take the heart out of me. I don’t know
what I’m saying and I’ve tried so hard&mdash;oh, Jack&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her voice broke, her head sank. Mr. Master’s expression
of boredom deepened into one of endurance.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” he asked with
weary patience.</p>

<p>“Come back. Don’t be angry. Forget what I
said.”</p>

<p>She began to cry, shielding her face with one
hand, the other still holding him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>He sighed, and glancing up, saw me. I expected
him to drive me forth with one fierce look. Instead
he made a slight grimace and reentered the room,
she holding to his sleeve. He dropped heavily on
the piano stool and she on the chair opposite, her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>hands in her lap, two lines of tears on her cheeks.
Neither said a word.</p>

<p>The way was clear and I flew out with the wild
rush of a bird escaping from a snare. As I ran
down the stairs the silence of that room, four walls
enclosing a tumult of warring passions, followed
me.</p>

<p>It’s midnight and I haven’t got over the ugliness
of it. What am I to think? The thing many people
would think, I won’t believe, I can’t believe. No
one who knew her could. That the unfortunate creature
loves him is past a doubt&mdash;but how can she?
How can she humiliate herself so? Where is the
pride that the rest of us have for a shield and
buckler. Where is the self-respect? To cry&mdash;to let
him see her cry, and then&mdash;that’s the <i>comble</i>, as
the Paris art students say&mdash;to call him back!</p>

<p>I feel sick, for I love her. If she hasn’t got a soul
or temperament or any of the rest of it that they do
so much talking about, she’s got something tucked
away somewhere that’s good, that’s true. It looks
at you out of her eyes, it speaks to you in her voice&mdash;and
then Masters comes along and it’s gone.</p>

<p>I stopped here, and biting the end of my pen,
looked gloomily at the wall and met the cold stare of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>my ancestors. I wonder what the men would have
said if they had been there this afternoon. I’m not
sure&mdash;men are men and Lizzie is beautiful. But
about you ladies, I can make a guess. You would
purse your mouths a little tighter and say, “Evelyn,
you’re keeping queer company. Whatever you may
think in your heart, drop her. That’s the wise
course.” All but the French Huguenot lady, she’s
got an understanding eye. She feels something that
the others never felt, probably saw a little deeper
into life and it softened the central spot.</p>

<p>No, my dears, you’re all wrong. You’re judging
by appearances and fixed standards, which is something
your descendant refuses to do. Go to sleep
and try and wake up more humble and humane.
Good night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>etty</span> had the dinner for Mr. Albertson last
night and of course I went, for Betty is like
royalty, she doesn’t invite, she commands. In a brief
telephone message she instructed me to wear my blue
crêpe and I wore it. Before dinner, in her room, she
eyed me critically and put a blue aigrette in my hair.</p>

<p>Mr. Albertson was a gallant Southerner with
courtly manners and a large bald spot. We got on
very nicely, though he did not exhibit that appreciation
of my charms that marked the Idaho man from
the moment of our meeting. If, however, he should
develop it I have resolved to crush it by strategy.
I don’t know just how yet&mdash;the only thing I can
think of at present is to ask him to call and pretend
I’m drunk like David Garrick. I’ll get a better idea
if the necessity arises. I haven’t the courage to defy
Betty twice.</p>

<p>Betty sent me home in the limousine, without the
footman and the chow dog. It was a cold still night,
the kind when the sky is a deep Prussian blue and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>all the lights have a fixed steady shine. As the car
wheeled into Fifth Avenue and I sat looking out of
the window, revolving schemes for the disenchanting
of Mr. Albertson, I saw Roger walking by. Before
I thought I had beckoned to him and struck on the
front window for the chauffeur to stop. The car
glided to the curb and Roger’s long black figure
came running across the street.</p>

<p>“You!” he cried, “like a fairy princess with a
feather in your hair. What ball are you coming
from, Cinderella?”</p>

<p>As soon as he spoke I grew shy. Do the women
who have ready tongues and the courage of their
moods, realize the value of their gifts?</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;it’s not a ball, it’s Betty Ferguson’s and
she’s sending me home.”</p>

<p>“All right.” He said something to the chauffeur,
stepped in and the car started. “What a piece of
luck. I was coming from a deadly dinner and going
to a deadly club. What inspired you to hail me?”</p>

<p>Nothing did, or something did that I couldn’t explain.
I felt round for an answer and produced the
first that came.</p>

<p>“I wanted to talk to you about something.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead.” He pulled the rug over me. “It’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>a nipping cold night abroad. Let’s hear what it
was you wanted to talk about.”</p>

<p>For a moment I thought of telling him of Lizzie
Harris and Mr. Masters, then I knew that wouldn’t
do. Lizzie’s secrets were my secrets. I had to tell
him something and in my embarrassment I told him
the first thing that came into my head.</p>

<p>“Betty asked me to dinner to meet a man from
Georgia.”</p>

<p>As soon as I had said it I had a sick feeling that
he might be wondering why I should stop him on
Fifth Avenue at eleven o’clock of a winter’s night,
to impart this piece of intelligence.</p>

<p>He received it with the dignity of a valuable communication.</p>

<p>“Did she? And what was he like?”</p>

<p>“Very charming. His name’s Albertson and he
has cotton mills down there.”</p>

<p>“Must be a man of means.”</p>

<p>“I believe he is.”</p>

<p>It was very nice of Roger to take it so simply and
naturally, but you can always rely on his manners.
My embarrassment passed away. The auto sped out
into the concentrated sparklings of Plaza Square,
then swerved to the left, sweeping round the statue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>of Sherman led to victory by a long-limbed and
resolute angel.</p>

<p>“We’re going the wrong way. What’s Nelson doing?”
I raised a hand to rap on the window.</p>

<p>“I told him to take us through the park. Put your
hand in your muff. Why did Betty ask you to meet
Mr. What’s-his-name from Georgia?”</p>

<p>I know every tone of Roger’s voice, and the one
he used to ask that question was chilly. Betty’s plans
involved no secrecy, so I said, laughing:</p>

<p>“I think she’s trying to make a match.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Roger.</p>

<p>I had thought he would laugh with me, but in that
brief monosyllable there was no amusement. It came
with a falling note, and it seemed to be a sort of extinguisher
on the conversation, a full stop at the end
of it, for we both fell silent.</p>

<p>The auto swept up the drive, gray and smooth between
gray trees. I could see a reach of deep blue
sky with the stars looking big and close, as if they
had come down a few billion miles and were looking
us over with an impartial curiosity. Across the park
the fronts of apartment-houses showed in gleaming
tiers, far up into the night, their lights yellower
than the stars. It was lovely to glide on, swiftly and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>smoothly, with the frost gripping the world in an
icy clasp while we were warm and snug and so
friendly that we could be silent.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this beautiful, Roger?” I said, looking out
of the window. “Look on the other side of the park,
hundreds of lights in hundreds of homes.”</p>

<p>Roger gave a sound that if I were a writer of
realistic tendencies, I should call a grunt.</p>

<p>We met a hansom with the glass down, and on an
ascending curve another auto swooping by with two
great glaring lamps. I felt quite oddly happy; the
menacing figure of Mr. Albertson became no more
than a bogy. After all even Betty couldn’t drag me
struggling to the altar.</p>

<p>“Why is Betty so anxious to marry you off?”
came suddenly from the corner beside me.</p>

<p>Mr. Albertson assumed his original shape as a
marriageable male with a bald spot and a cotton
mill, and Betty slipped back into position. I wasn’t
sure she couldn’t drag any one to the altar if she
made up her mind to it. My voice showed the oppression
of this thought.</p>

<p>“She thinks all women should be married.”</p>

<p>“You have been married.”</p>

<p>Something was the matter with Roger to say that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Well, she thinks I’m poor and lonely.”</p>

<p>“Are you?”</p>

<p>I began to have an uncomfortable, complicated
feeling. Fear was in it, also exhilaration. It made
me sit up stiffly, suddenly conscious of a sensation of
trembling somewhere inside.</p>

<p>“I am poor,” I said, “that is, poor compared to
people like Betty.”</p>

<p>“And lonely, too?”</p>

<p>The disturbance grew. It made me draw away
from Roger, pressed close into my corner, as if no
scrap or edge of my clothing must touch him. I was
afraid that my voice would show it and determined
that it mustn’t.</p>

<p>“I’m lonely sometimes. That rainy night when
you came in unexpectedly I was.”</p>

<p>My voice <i>wasn’t</i> all right. I cleared my throat and
pretended to look at the stars.</p>

<p>Roger said nothing, but the secret subways of
emotion that connect the spirits of those who are in
close communion, told me he, too, was moved. The
air in the closed scented car did not seem enough for
natural breathing. It was like a pressure, something
that put your heart-beats out of tune, and made your
lips open with a noiseless gasp. I stood it as long as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>I could and then words burst out of me. They came
anyway, ridiculous words when I write them down:</p>

<p>“But I’ll never marry any of them. No matter
what they are, or what Betty wants, or how many of
them she has up to dinner.”</p>

<p>The pressure was lifted and I sank back trembling.
It was as if I had been under water and come up
again into the air. The spiritual telegraph told me
that Roger felt as I did, and that suddenly he or I
or both of us, had broken down a barrier. It was
swept away and we were close together&mdash;closer than
the night when we had held hands and forgotten
where we were, closer than we’d ever been in all
the years we’d known each other. It was not necessary
to say anything. In our several corners we sat
silent, understanding for the first time, I and the
man I loved.</p>

<p>The sharp landscape slid by us, naked trees,
spotted lines of light, stretches of lawn grizzled with
frost, woodland depths with the shine of ice about
the tree roots, and then the flash of glassy ponds.</p>

<p>We sat as still as if we were dead, as if our souls
had come out of our bodies and were whispering.
It was a wonderful moment of time, one of the unforgetable
moments that dot the long material years.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>All that’s gone before and all that’s going to come
dies away and there’s only the present&mdash;the beautiful
exquisite present. We only have a few like that
in our lives.</p>

<p>It lasted till the auto drew up at my door. We said
good night and parted.</p>

<p>Up in my room I sat a long time by the fire thinking
of the hundreds of women like myself, the disillusioned
ones, in the dark dens of tenements and
in the splendid homes near by. I tried to send them
messages through the night, telling them we could
rise out of the depths. I saw life as it really is, hills
and valleys, patches of blackness and then light,
but always with an unresting force flowing beneath,
the immortal thing that urges and upholds and
makes it all possible. I remembered words I used to
work on bits of perforated board when I was a little
girl, “God is Love.” I never understood what it
meant, even when I stopped working it on perforated
board and grew to the reasoning stage. To-night
I knew&mdash;got at last what a happy child might
understand&mdash;love in the heart was God with us,
come back to us again.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>esterday</span> was the concert day and I
couldn’t go&mdash;a bad cold. The house lamented
from all its floors, for it was going en masse, even the
trained nurse with a usurped right to the sun-dial.</p>

<p>The only way I could add to the festivity of the
occasion was to distribute my possessions among that
section of the audience drawn from Mrs. Bushey’s
light housekeeping apartments. It began with the
Signorita Bonaventura, who wore my mother’s diamond
pendant, then went down the line:&mdash; Miss
Gorringe my green satin (she said it would be horribly
unbecoming, but the audience wouldn’t notice
her), Miss Bliss my black lynx furs, Mrs. Phillips,
the nurse, my evening cloak, Mr. Hazard my opera
glasses, Mr. Weatherby my umbrella&mdash;his had a
broken rib and it looked like snow. We were afraid
the count couldn’t find anything suitable to his age
and sex, but he emptied my bottle of Coty’s Jacqueminot
on his handkerchief and left, scented like a
florist’s. Mrs. Bushey came last and gleaned the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>field, a gold bracelet, a marabou stole and a lace
handkerchief she swore she wouldn’t use.</p>

<p>Much noise accompanied the passage of the day
and some threatening mishaps. At eleven we heard
Berwick was hoarse, but at one (by telephone
through my room) that raw eggs and massage were
restoring him. At midday Miss Gorringe sent a
frantic message that the sash of the green satin
wasn’t in the box. Gloom settled at two with a bulletin
that Mrs. Stregazzi’s second child had croup. It
was better at five. Mr. Hazard’s dress suit smelled
so of moth balls that the prima donna said it would
taint the air, and Emma, the maid, hung it out on the
sacred sun-dial. There was a battle over this. For
fifteen minutes it raged up two flights of stairs, then
Mr. Hazard conquered and the sun-dial was draped
in black broadcloth.</p>

<p>At intervals Lizzie came down to see me and use
the telephone. She was in her most aloof mood, forbidding,
self-absorbed. On one of her appearances
she found a group of us congregated about my steam
kettle. Our chatter died away before her rapt and
unresponsive eye. Even I, who was used to it, felt
myself fading like a photographic proof in a too
brilliant sun. As for the others they looked small and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>frightened, like mice in the presence of a well-fed
lioness, who, though she might not want to eat them,
was still a lioness. They breathed deep and unlimbered
when the door shut on her.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon Roger came to see me. He
brought a bunch of violets and a breath of winter
into my bright little room. The threatening snow
had begun to fall, lodging delicately on eaves and
ledges, a scurry of tiny particles against the light of
street-lamps. We stood in the window and watched
it, trimming the house-fronts with white, carpeting
the steps, spreading a blanket ever so softly and
deftly over the tin roof. How different to the rain,
the insistent ruthless rain. The night when the rain
fell came back to me. How different that was from
to-night!</p>

<p>There was a hubbub of voices from the hall and
then a knock. They were coming to see me before
they left. They entered, streaming in, grubs turned
to butterflies. The house was going cheaply in cars
over the bridge; only the prima donna and Miss
Gorringe were to travel aristocratically in a cab.</p>

<p>Strong scents from the count’s Jacqueminot
mingled with the faint odor of moth balls that Mr.
Hazard’s dress suit still harbored. Miss Gorringe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>had rouged a little and the green satin was quite
becoming. Miss Bliss had rouged a good deal and
had had her hair marcelled. In the doorway the
trained nurse hung back, sniffing contemptuously at
Mr. Hazard’s back. Mrs. Bushey, Mr. Hamilton and
Mr. Weatherby grouped themselves by the fireplace.</p>

<p>“Where’s the prima donna?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Coming,” cried a voice from the stairs, and the
air was filled with silken rustlings.</p>

<p>It was like an entrance on the stage, up the passage
and between the watching people, and I don’t
think any actress could have done it with more
aplomb. In her evening dress she was truly superb&mdash;a
goddess of a woman with her black hair in lusterless
coils and her neck and shoulders as white as
curds. Upon that satiny bosom my mother’s pendant
rose and fell to even breathings. Whatever anybody
else may have felt, the star of the occasion was
calm and confident.</p>

<p>Her appearance had so much of the theatrical
that it must have made us suddenly see her as the
professional, the legitimate object of glances and
comments. Nothing else could explain why I&mdash;a
person of restrained enthusiasms&mdash;should have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>broken into bald compliments. She took them with
no more self-consciousness than a performing animal
takes the gallery’s applause, smiled slightly, then
looked at Roger, the stranger. I did so, too, childishly
anxious to see if he admired my protégée. He
evidently did, for he was staring with the rest of
them, intent, astonished.</p>

<p>Her glance appeared to gather up his tribute as
her hands might have gathered flowers thrown to
her. He was one of the watching thousands that it
was her business to enthrall, his face one of the
countless faces that were to gaze up at her from
tier upon tier of seats.</p>

<p>When the door shut on the last of them, laughter
and good nights diminishing down the stairs, he
turned to me with an air that was at once bewildered
and accusing.</p>

<p>“Why in heaven’s name didn’t you tell me she
was so good-looking?”</p>

<p>“I did and you wouldn’t believe me,” I answered
gaily, for I was greatly pleased. It was a little
triumph over Roger with his hypercritical taste and
his rare approvals.</p>

<p>The next morning I waited anxiously for news.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>I thought Lizzie would be down early, but the others
came before her, dropping in as the morning wore
away. With each entrance I grew more uneasy.</p>

<p>Mr. Hazard was first, in a gray sweater.</p>

<p>“Well, she looked great. I wish I could have
painted her that way. But&mdash;” he tilted his head, his
expression grown dubious. “You know, Mrs. Drake,
I don’t know one tune from another&mdash;but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But what?” I said sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, it seemed to me Berwick got away with it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the audience liked him better?”</p>

<p>He nodded, a grave agreeing eye on me.</p>

<p>“He got them when he sang that thing about <i>The
Three Grenadiers</i>. It made your heart swell up.”</p>

<p>He leaned nearer, lowering his voice. “And he
got them in that German duet, too.”</p>

<p>He drew back and nodded again darkly, as if
wishing me to catch a meaning too direful for words.</p>

<p>An hour later Miss Bliss blew in in a blue flannel
jacket and the remnants of her marcelle wave. By
contrast with her flushed and blooming appearance
of the evening before, she looked pinched and pallid.
She cowered over the fire, stretching her little
chapped hands to the blaze and presenting a narrow
humped back to my gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“She didn’t seem to catch on some way or other.
I don’t know why but&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped and leaned forward for the poker.</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;” She poked the fire, the edge of the
flannel jacket hitched up by the movement, showing
a section of corset laced with the golden string that
confines candy boxes. “She doesn’t give you any
thrill. I’ve heard people without half so much voice
who could make the tears come into your eyes. I
tell you what, Mrs. Drake,” she turned round with
the poker uplifted in emphasis, “<i>I</i> wouldn’t spend
<i>my</i> good money to hear a woman sing that way.
If I shell out one-fifty I want to get a thrill.”</p>

<p>She was still there when the count came in. He
sat between us gently rocking and eying her with a
pensive stare. She pulled down her jacket and patted
solicitously at the remains of her marcelle.</p>

<p>“She looked,” said the count, pausing in his
rocking, “she looked like a queen.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious,” I cried crossly, “<i>do</i> drop her
looks. I saw her.”</p>

<p>The count, unmoved by my irritation, answered
mildly:</p>

<p>“One can’t drop them so easily.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“But her singing, her performance?”</p>

<p>“Her performance,” murmured the young man,
and appeared to look through Miss Bliss at a distant
prospect. “It was good, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>I had to restrain myself from screaming, “But
what?”</p>

<p>“It was not so good as she is, had none of the&mdash;what
shall I say&mdash;<i>air noble</i> that she has.” He
screwed up his eyes as if projecting his vision not
only through Miss Bliss, but through all intervening
objects to a realm of pure criticism. “It has a
bourgeois quality, no distinction, no imagination,
and she&mdash;” Words were inadequate and he finished
the sentence with a shrug.</p>

<p>Miss Bliss leaned forward and poked the fire,
once more revealing the golden string. The count
looked at it with a faint arrested interest. I was
depressed, but conventions are instinctive, and I said
sternly:</p>

<p>“Miss Bliss, let the count poke the fire.”</p>

<p>The count poked and Miss Bliss slipped to the
floor, and sitting cross-legged, comfortably warmed
her back.</p>

<p>The count was gone when Mrs. Bushey entered.
Mrs. Bushey says she understands music even as she
does physical culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“It was a frost,” she explained, dropping on the
end of the sofa.</p>

<p>“I know that,” I answered, “the paper this morning
said the thermometer was twenty-two degrees.”</p>

<p>“Not that kind of a frost, a theatrical frost for
her. She hasn’t got the quality.”</p>

<p>“No thrill,” murmured Miss Bliss, and no men
being present, stretched out her feet and legs in worn
slippers and threadbare stockings to the blaze.</p>

<p>I fought against my depression&mdash;Mrs. Bushey did
not like Bonaventura.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t got the equipment,” said Mrs. Bushey
with a sagacious air. Her eye roamed about the
room and lighted on Miss Bliss’ legs. “<i>Are</i> you
cold?” she asked, as if amazed.</p>

<p>“Frozen,” answered Miss Bliss crossly.</p>

<p>“How can that be possible when I’ve done everything
to make your room warm, spent all my winter
earnings on coal?”</p>

<p>Miss Bliss cocked up her chin and replied:</p>

<p>“You must have had very poor business this winter.”
Then to me very pointedly: “I wanted to ask
you, Mrs. Drake, if you’d lend me your Navajo
blanket, just for a few nights. It would look so bad
for the house if I was found frozen to death in bed
some morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>I agreed with alarmed haste, but Mrs. Bushey
did not seem inclined for war. She smiled, murmuring,
“Poor girl, you’re anemic,” and then, her eye
lighting on Marie Antoinette’s mirror:</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Harris’ll never get anywhere till she
gets some color into her voice. It’s the coldest organ
I ever heard. Would you mind if I took that mirror
away? I have a new lodger, a delightful woman
from Philadelphia, and I’ve no mirror for her&mdash;I
can’t, I literally <i>can’t</i>, buy one with my finances the
way they are. I suppose after this failure Miss Harris’ll
be late with her rent.”</p>

<p>Thus Mrs. Bushey. When she had gone&mdash;taking
the mirror&mdash;Miss Bliss lay flat before the fire and
reviled her.</p>

<p>Miss Gorringe came next with the green satin
dress. It was upon Miss Gorringe I was pinning my
hopes. None of the others knew anything. Miss
Gorringe, lifting out the dress with cold and careful
hands, looked solemn:</p>

<p>“No, I can’t say it was a success. I’d like to because
she’s certainly one of the most lovely people
I’ve ever played for, but&mdash;” She depressed the corners
of her mouth and slowly shook her head.</p>

<p>I sat up in my shawls and did scream:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>Miss Gorringe, used to the eccentricities of artists,
was unmoved by my violence. She placed the dress
carefully over the back of a chair.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t get over,” she said.</p>

<p>“Get over what?”</p>

<p>I had heard this cryptic phrase before, but didn’t
know what it meant.</p>

<p>“The footlights&mdash;across, into the audience. And
she ought to, but they were as cold as frogs till Berwick
woke them up with <i>The Three Grenadiers</i>. <i>He</i>
can do it. He hasn’t got any better voice or method
but,” she gave a little ecstatic gesture, “temperament&mdash;oh,
my!”</p>

<p>“Has she got no temperament at all?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve never played for anybody who had less.”
Miss Gorringe held up the green scarf. “Here’s the
sash.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of thrill,” Miss Bliss chanted, prone before
the fire.</p>

<p>“Can’t a person get temperament, learn it in some
way?”</p>

<p>Miss Gorringe pondered:</p>

<p>“They can teach them rôles, hammer it into them.
When a person’s got the looks she has they sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
do it. But I guess they’ve done all they can
for her. She’s been with Vignorol for two years. He
wouldn’t have taken her unless he thought there was
something in it. And John Masters has been training
her besides, and I’ve heard people say there’s
no one better than Masters for that. You see they
can teach her how to walk and stand and make
gestures, but they can’t put the thing into her head
or her voice. She doesn’t seem to understand, she
doesn’t feel.”</p>

<p>I was silent. She did feel, I knew it, I’d seen it.
There was some queer lack of coordination between
her power to feel and her power to express.</p>

<p>Miss Gorringe administered the coup de grâce.</p>

<p>“She sang the duet from <i>The Valkyrie</i> as if she
was telling Siegmund to put on his hat and come to
supper.”</p>

<p>“It’s imagination,” I said.</p>

<p>“It’s temperament,” Miss Gorringe corrected.
“And without it, the way she is, she’d better go in
for church singing, or oratorio, or even teaching.”</p>

<p>The dusk was gathering and I was alone when she
came down. She threw herself into the wicker chair
beside my sofa. Her face looked thinner and two
slight lines showed round her mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” I said, investing my voice with a fictitious
lightness. “Where have you been all day?”</p>

<p>“I’m tired or I’d have been down earlier. Have
you seen the others?”</p>

<p>With her deadly directness she had gone straight
to the point I dreaded.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ve been in.”</p>

<p>“Did they like it?”</p>

<p>One of the most formidable things about this
woman is the way she keeps placing you in positions
where you must either lie and lose your self-respect
or tell the truth and incur her sudden and alarming
anger. I was not afraid of that now, but I couldn’t
hurt her. I tried to find a sentence that would be
as truthful and painless as the circumstances permitted.
The search took a moment.</p>

<p>“They didn’t,” she answered for me.</p>

<p>She turned her face to the window and drummed
on the chair-arm with her fingers, then said defiantly:</p>

<p>“They don’t know anything.”</p>

<p>“Of course they don’t,” I cried. “An Italian
count, an artist, a model, a woman who rents floors.”</p>

<p>Her eye fell on the green dress.</p>

<p>“Miss Gorringe has been here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“What did <i>she</i> say?”</p>

<p>I got cold under my wrappings. Had I the courage
to tell her? She looked at me and gave a slight
wry smile.</p>

<p>“Did she tell you that Berwick got away with it?”</p>

<p>“Some one did. I think it was Mr. Hazard, but
he’s a painter and&mdash;”</p>

<p>She interrupted roughly.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing&mdash;a big bawling voice singing
popular songs. If they’d let me sing <i>Oh, Promise
Me</i> I’d have had the whole house.”</p>

<p>For the first time in my experience of her I saw
she was not open with herself. I knew that she had
realized her failure and refused to admit it. She
leaned forward, her elbows on her knees, frowning,
haggard and miserable.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the notices to-morrow,” she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>It was horribly pitiful. There would be no
friendly deception about the notices.</p>

<p>“Vignorol’s arranged for several good men to go.
He wanted their opinions. They’ll give me a fine
notice on <i>The Valkyrie</i> duet.”</p>

<p>“Did that go well?” I asked just for something to
say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, splendidly,” she answered, without looking
up. “It’s one of the things I do best.”</p>

<p>The room was getting dim and I was thankful for
it. The dusk hid the drooping and discouraged face,
but it could not shut out the voice with its desperate
pretense. It was worse than the face.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said suddenly, straightening up, “I’ll
see Masters to-morrow. He’s coming to bring me
the notices.”</p>

<p>There was fear in the voice. I knew what the interview
with Masters would be, and she knew, too.
In a moment of insight I saw that she had been
fighting against her dread all day, had come down
to me for courage, was trying now to draw it from
my chill and depressing presence. It was like a
child afraid of the dark, hanging about in terror and
unwilling to voice its alarm.</p>

<p>I sat up, throwing off my wraps and laid my hand
on hers.</p>

<p>“Lizzie, don’t mind what he says.”</p>

<p>Her hand was cold under mine.</p>

<p>“He knows,” she answered almost in a whisper,
“he <i>knows</i>.”</p>

<p>“I can get backers for you”&mdash;it was rash, but I
know how to manage Betty&mdash;“better than he ever
was, the best kind of backers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>She jerked her hand away and glared at me.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that? Do you think he’s
going to give me up? Why, you must be crazy.” She
jumped to her feet looking down at me with a face
of savage anger. “Do you think I haven’t made
good? Have they,” with a violent gesture to the
door, “told you so? They’re fools, idiots, imbeciles.
Masters give me up&mdash;ah&mdash;” She turned away and
then back. “Why he’s never had any one with such
promise as I have. He’s banking on me. I’m going
to bring him to the top. He borrowed the money to
send me to Vignorol. Throw me down now, just
when I’m getting there, just when I’m proving he
was right? Oh, I can’t talk to you. You’ve no sense.
You’re as big a fool as all the rest.”</p>

<p>And she rushed out of the room, banging the door
till the whole apartment shook.</p>

<p>I lay thinking about it till Emma came to get me
my supper. She was right in one thing&mdash;I <i>was</i> a
fool. In my blundering attempt at encouragement
I had gone straight to the heart of her fear, dragged
it out into the light, held up in front of her the
thing she was trying not to see&mdash;that Masters would
give her up. Fool&mdash;it was a mild name for me. And
<i>poor</i> Lizzie&mdash;tragic Bonaventura!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>It’s night again and I am dressed in my best with
a fur cloak on to keep off the chill. I’ve got to write,
not a sudden visitation of the Muse, but to ease my
mind. If you haven’t got a sympathetic pair of ears
to pour your troubles into, pouring them out on paper
is the next best thing.</p>

<p>It’s two days since I have seen Lizzie. Yesterday
I was in my room all day nursing my cold and expecting
her, but she didn’t come. Neither did she
to-day, and all I could surmise was that she was
angry with me for being a fool. As I feel I was
one and yet don’t like to hear it from other people,
I made no effort to get into communication with her.</p>

<p>This evening I was well enough to go out in a
cab with all my furs and a foot warmer, to dine with
Roger’s widowed sister, Mrs. Ashworth. I was a
good deal fluttered over the dinner, guessed why it
had been arranged. It was a small affair, the Fergusons,
Roger and I. Preceded by a call from Mrs.
Ashworth, it had a meaningful aspect, a delicate
suggestion of welcoming me into the family. I blush
as I write it. I don’t know why I should, or why
love and marriage are matters surrounded by self-consciousness
and shame. Who was it explained the
embarrassment of lovers, their tendency to hide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>themselves in corners, as an instinctive sense of guilt
at the prospect of bringing children into a miserable
world? I think it was Schopenhauer. Sounds like
him&mdash;cross-grained old misanthrope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashworth is Roger’s only near relation and
he regards her as the choicest flower of womanhood.
I don’t wonder. In her way she is a finished
product, no raw edges, no loose ends. Everything
is in harmony&mdash;her thin faintly-lined face, her
silky white hair, her pale hands with slightly prominent
veins, her voice with its gentle modulations.
Nothing cheap or second rate could exist near her.
She wouldn’t stamp them out&mdash;I can’t imagine her
stamping&mdash;they would simply wither in the rarified
atmosphere. Her friends are like herself, her house
is like herself. When I go there I feel strident and
coarse. As I enter the portal I instinctively tune
my key lower, feel my high lights fading, undergo
a refining and subduing process as if a chromo were
being transmuted into a Bartolozzi engraving.</p>

<p>As my cab crawled down-town&mdash;I need hardly
say Mrs. Ashworth lives in a house on lower Fifth
Avenue, built by her father&mdash;I uneasily wondered
if the Bohemian atmosphere in which I dwelt had
left any marks upon me. I tried to obliterate them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>and made mental notes of things I mustn’t mention.
Memories of Miss Bliss’ golden corset string rose uneasily,
and Lizzie Harris, and oh, Mr. Masters! I
ended by achieving a sense of grievance against Mrs.
Ashworth. No one had any right to be so refined.
It was all very well if you inherited a social circle
and large means, but&mdash; The cab drew up with a
jolt and I alighted. All unseemly exuberance died
as the light from the door fell on me. I spoke so
softly the driver had difficulty in hearing my order
and when I walked up the steps I minced daintily.</p>

<p>But it was a delightful dinner. Harry and I were
on one side, Betty and Roger on the other. At the
foot of the table was Mrs. Ashworth’s son, Roger
Clements Ashworth, a charming boy still at college.
It was all perfectly done, nothing showy, nothing in
the fashion. Betty’s pearls looked a good deal too
large beside the modest string that Mrs. Ashworth
wore, which was given to her great, great grandmother
by Admiral Rochambeau. The dining-room
walls were lined with portraits, with over the fireplace,
that foundation stone of the family’s glory,
Roger Clements, “The Signer.”</p>

<p>I thought of my apartment and my late associates
and felt that I was leading a double life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>When I came home the house was very silent.
Mounting the dim dirty stairs with the smell of dead
dinners caught in the corners, I wondered how Mrs.
Ashworth could countenance me. But after all, it
was part of her fineness that she had no quarrel with
the obscure and lowly. If she could not broaden the
walls of her world&mdash;and you had only to talk to her
ten minutes to see that she couldn’t&mdash;within those
walls all was choice and lovely. I would have to live
up to it, that was all.</p>

<p>I had got that far when I heard a heavy step and
Mr. Masters loomed up on the flight above. The
stairs are very narrow and I looked up smiling, expecting
him to retreat. He came on, however, not
returning my smile, staring straight before him with
an immovable, brooding glance. I can’t say he
didn’t see me, but he had the air of being so preoccupied
that what his eye lighted on did not penetrate
to his brain. As at our first meeting I received
an impression of brutal strength, his broad shoulders
seeming to push the walls back, his flat-topped head
upheld on a neck like a gladiator. I intended asking
him about the concert and the notices, but his look
froze me, and I backed against the wall for him to
pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>As he brushed by he growled a word of greeting.
He was in the hall below when I broke out of
the consternation created by his manner, leaned
over the rail and called down:</p>

<p>“Mr. Masters, how is Miss Harris?”</p>

<p>“All right,” he muttered without stopping or
looking up and went on down the lower flight to the
street.</p>

<p>They had had the interview.</p>

<p>The house was as silent as a tomb. I stole to the
foot of the upper flight, looked up and listened. Not
a sound. The rustling of my dress as I moved startled
me. What <i>had</i> he said to her? I couldn’t read
his face&mdash;but his manner! I wavered and waited,
the street noises coming muffled through the intense
stillness. Then I decided I’d not intrude upon her,
and came in here. Whatever happened she’ll tell me
in her own good time, and the quietness up there is
reassuring. Her anger is apt to take noisy forms.
If she had been throwing oranges out of the window
I would have heard her. But I do wish I might have
seen her to-night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="X">X</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> didn’t</span> sleep well that night. The memory of
Mr. Masters’ set sullen face kept me wakeful.
At four I got up, lit the light and tried to read
Kidd’s <i>Social Evolution</i>. Through the ceiling I
could hear Mr. Hamilton’s subdued snoring on the
floor above. It seemed like the deep and labored
breathing of that submerged world whose upward
struggle I was following through Mr. Kidd’s illuminating
page.</p>

<p>After breakfast, when no sign or word had come
from Lizzie, I decided to stay in till I heard from
her. I dawdled through the morning and when
Emma was cleaning up went out on the landing and
listened. The upper floors were wrapt in quiet. I
stole up a flight and a half and looked at her door&mdash;tight
shut and not a sound. I went down again worried,
though it was possible she had gone out and I
not heard her. After lunch I opened the register
and listened&mdash;complete silence. During the rest of
the afternoon I sat waiting for her footfall. Dusk
came and no woman had mounted the stairs. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>seven a tap came at my door and Count Delcati
pushed it open.</p>

<p>The count brought letters from the Italian aristocracy
to its New York imitation and goes to entertainments
that the rest of us read of in the papers.
He was arrayed for festival and looked like an up-to-date
French poster, a high-shouldered black figure
with slender arms slightly bowed out at the
elbows. His collar was very stiff, his shirt bosom a
clear expanse of thick smooth white. He wore his
silk hat back from his forehead, and his youthful yet
sophisticated face, with its intense black eyes and
dash of dark mustache, might have been looking at
me from the walls of the Salon Independent.</p>

<p>He removed his hat, and standing in the doorway,
said:</p>

<p>“Have you seen her to-day?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered. “Have you?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I think she must be away. When I came home at
six I went up there and knocked, but there was no
answer.”</p>

<p>There was nothing in this to increase my uneasiness.
She came and went at all hours, often taking
her dinner at what she called “little joints” in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>lower reaches of the city. Nevertheless my uneasiness
did increase, gripped hold of me as I looked at
the young man’s gravely attentive face.</p>

<p>“Have you seen her since the concert?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, the day after, when you were all in here.”</p>

<p>“She hadn’t seen the notices?”</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>He leaned against the door-post and gazed at his
patent leather shoes. As if with reluctance he said
slowly:</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“What were they like?”</p>

<p>“Rotten.”</p>

<p>He pronounced the word with the “r” strangled
yet protesting, as if he had rolled his tongue round it,
torn it from its place and put it away somewhere in
the recesses of his throat.</p>

<p>“Oh, poor girl!” I moaned.</p>

<p>“That’s why I went up there. She must have seen
them and I wished to assure her they were lies.”</p>

<p>“Did they say anything very awful?”</p>

<p>He shrugged.</p>

<p>“They spoke of her beauty&mdash;one said she had a
good mezzo voice. But they were not kind to her, to
Mr. Berwick, <i>very</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>I said nothing, sunk in gloom.</p>

<p>The count picked up his fur-lined coat from the
stair rail, and shook himself into it.</p>

<p>“I should wait to go to her when she comes in,
but this <i>meeserable</i> dinner, where I sit beside young
girls who know nothing and married ladies who
know too much&mdash;no mystery, no allure. But I must
go&mdash;perhaps you?&mdash;” He looked at me tentatively
over his fur collar.</p>

<p>“I’ll go up as soon as she comes in,” I answered.
“If there’s anything I can do for her be assured I’ll
do it.”</p>

<p>“You are a sweet lady,” said the count and departed.</p>

<p>After that I sat with the door open a crack waiting
and listening. The hours ticked by. I heard Mr.
Hamilton’s step on the street stairs, a knock at the
Westerner’s door, and as it opened to him, a joyous
clamor of greeting in which Miss Bliss’ little treble
piped shrilly. Hazard was painting her and she
spent most of her evenings in there with them. It
was a good thing, they were decent fellows and their
room was properly heated.</p>

<p>At intervals the sounds of their mirth came from
below. The rest of the house was dumb. At eleven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>I could stand it no more and went up. If she wasn’t
there I could light up the place for her&mdash;she rarely
locked her door&mdash;and have it bright and warm.</p>

<p>It was dimly lighted and very still on the top floor,
the gas-jet tipping the burner in a small pale point
of light. I knocked and got no answer, then opened
the door and went in. The room was dark, the window
opposite a faint blue square. In the draft
made by the opening door the gas shot up as if
frightened, then sunk down, sending its thin gleam
over the threshold. As I moved I bumped into the
table and heard a thumping of something falling on
the floor. I saw afterward it was oranges. I groped
for matches, lighted the gas and looked about, then
gave a jump and a startled exclamation. Lizzie
Harris was lying on the sofa.</p>

<p>“Lizzie,” I cried sharply, angry from my fright,
“why didn’t you say you were there?”</p>

<p>She made no sound or movement and seized by a
wild fear, I ran to her. At the first glance I thought
she was dead. She was as white as a china plate,
lying flat on her back with her eyes shut, her hands
clasped over her waist. I touched one of them and
knew by the warmth she was alive. I clutched it,
shaking it and crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Lizzie, what’s the matter? Are you ill?”</p>

<p>She tried to withdraw it and turned her face away.
The movement was feeble, suggesting an ebbing
vitality. I thought of suicide, and in a panic looked
about for glasses and vials. There was nothing of
the kind near her. In my lightning survey I saw a
scattering of newspaper cuttings on the table among
the rest of the oranges.</p>

<p>“Have you taken anything, medicine, poison?” I
cried in my terror.</p>

<p>“No,” she whispered. “Go away. Let me alone.”</p>

<p>I was sorry for her, but I was also angry. She
had given me a horrible fright. Failure and criticism
were hard to bear, but there was no sense taking
them this way.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> the matter then? What’s happened to
make you like this?”</p>

<p>“Let me alone,” she repeated, and lifting one
hand, held it palm upward over her face.</p>

<p>That something was wrong was indisputable, but
I couldn’t do anything till I knew what it was. I
put my fingers on the hand over her face and felt
for her pulse. I don’t know why, for I haven’t the
least idea how a pulse ought to beat. As it was I
couldn’t find any beat at all and dropped her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll have to get a doctor, I’ll call the man in the
boarding house opposite.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she said in a voice which, for the first
time, showed a note of life. “If you bring a doctor
here I’ll go out in the street as I am.”</p>

<p>She was in the blue kimono. I didn’t know whether
she had strength enough to move, but if she had I
knew that she would do as she said and the night
was freezing.</p>

<p>“I won’t call the doctor if you’ll tell me what’s
happened to you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” she said, and raising the hand from
her face caught at my skirt. I bent down for her
voice was very low, hardly more than a whisper.</p>

<p>“Masters has left me.”</p>

<p>“Left you,” I echoed, bewildered. “He was here
last night. I saw him.”</p>

<p>Her eyes held mine.</p>

<p>“Left me for good,” she whispered, “forever.”</p>

<p>Any words that I might have had ready to brace
up a discouraged spirit died away.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what do you mean?” I faltered.</p>

<p class="p2b">“He and I were lovers&mdash;lived together&mdash;you must
have known it. He got tired of me&mdash;sick of me&mdash;he
told me so himself&mdash;those very words. He said he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>was done with it all, the singing and me.” She
turned her head away and looked at the wall. “I’ve
been here ever since. I don’t know how long.”</p>

<p class="caption">“Masters has left me”</p>

<p class="p2">I stood without moving, looking at her, and she
seemed as dead to my presence as if she had really
been the corpse I at first thought her. Presently I
found myself putting a rug over her, settling it with
careful hands as if it occupied my entire thoughts.</p>

<p>I do not exactly know what did occupy them.
A sort of sick disgust permeated me, a deep overwhelming
disgust of life. Everything was vile, the
world, the people in it, the sordid dirt of their lives.
I almost wished that I might die to be out of it all.</p>

<p>Then I sat down beside her. She lay turned to
the wall, with the light of the one burner making
long shadows in the folds of the rug. Her neck and
cheek had the hard whiteness of marble, her hair,
like a piece of black cloth, laid along them. The
sickening feeling of repugnance persisted, stronger
than any pity for her. I suppose it was the long
reach of tradition, an inherited point of view, transmitted
by those prim and buckramed ladies on my
dining-room wall, and also perhaps that I had never
known a woman, well, as a friend, who had done
what Lizzie Harris had done. It was the first time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>in my life, which had moved so precisely in its prescribed
groove, that I had ever taken to my heart,
believed in, grieved over, loved and trusted a woman
thus stained and fallen.</p>

<p>I will also add, for I am truthful with myself,
that when I got up and went to her, all inclination
to touch her, to console and comfort her, was gone.
For those first few moments she was physically objectionable
to me, as if she might have been covered
with dirt. Yet I felt that I must look after her, had
what I suppose you would call a sense of duty where
she was concerned. I have always hated the phrase;
to me it signifies a dry sterile thing, and it held me
there because I would have been uncomfortable if I
had gone. Is it the training women get in their
youth that makes them like this, makes them only
give their best when the object is worthy, as we ask
only the people to dinner who can give us a good
dinner back? I heard the sense of duty chill in my
voice as I spoke to her.</p>

<p>“Have you had anything to eat since&mdash;that is,
to-day?”</p>

<p>She did not answer. I bent farther over and
looked at the profile with the eyes closed. They
were sunken, as if by days of pain. I have seen a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>good many sick people in my life, but I had never
seen any one so changed in so short a time. I gazed
down at her and the appeal of that marred and
anguished face suddenly broke through everything,
stabbed down through the world’s armor into the
human core. I tried to seize hold of her, to make
my hands tell her, and cried out in the poor words
that are our best:</p>

<p>“Oh, Lizzie, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry for you.”</p>

<p>It was like taking hold of a dead body. Her arm
fell from my hand an inert weight. Condemnation
or condonement were all the same to her.</p>

<p>What was I to do? The clock marked midnight.
The joyful sounds from below had ceased. I did
not like to rouse the others, for, as far as I could
see, she was in no immediate danger. She appeared
to be in a condition of collapse, and I had never
heard of any one dying of that. It was twenty-four
hours since I had seen Masters on the stairs. She
had had nothing to eat since then. Food was the
best thing and I went into the kitchen to get some.</p>

<p>The top floor has what Miss Bliss calls “the bulge”
on all others by having a small but complete kitchen.
The gaslight showed it in a state of chaos, piles of
plates waiting to be washed, the ice-box with opened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>door and a milk bottle overturned, some linen lying
swathed and sodden over the edge of the laundry
tub. I made a brew of tea and brought it to her, but
one might as well have tried to make a statue drink.
In answer to my pleadings she turned completely to
the wall, moving one hand to the top of her head
where it lay outstretched with spread fingers. In
the faintly lighted room, in the creeping cold of a
December midnight, that speechless woman with her
open hand resting on her head, was the most tragic
figure I have ever seen.</p>

<p>I took the tea back to the kitchen and washed the
plates. Also I hunted over the place for any means
of self-destruction that might be there. There were
vials in the medicine closet that I stood in a row and
inspected, emptying those I wasn’t sure about into
the sink. As I worked I thought, sometimes pursuing
a consecutive series of ideas, sometimes in disconnected
jumps. It was revolutionary thinking,
casting out old ideals, installing new ones. I was
outside the limits within which I had heretofore
ranged, was looking beyond the familiar horizon.
In that untidy kitchen, sniffing at medicine bottles, I
had glimpses far beyond the paths where I had left
my little trail of footprints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>I didn’t know why she had given herself to Masters.
Strange as it may sound, it did not then seem
to me to matter. It was her affair, concern for her
conscience, not mine. What was my concern was that
I could not give my love and take it back. It went
deeper than her passions and her weaknesses. It
went below the surface of life, underlay the complicated
web of conduct and action. It was the one
thing that was sure amid the welter of shock and
amaze.</p>

<p>And I understood Masters, was suddenly shifted
into his place and saw his side. He had tried to
make her understand and she wouldn’t, then on the
straining tie that held them had dealt a savage blow,
brought an impossible situation to the only possible
end. I hated him, if she had been nothing to me I
would have hated him. Shaking a bottle of collodion
over the sink I muttered execrations on him, and as
I muttered knew that I admired the brutal courage
that had set them both free.</p>

<p>The dawn found me sitting by her frozen in mind
and body. I had had time to think of what I should
say to all inquiries: the failure of the concert, the
blow to her hopes, had prostrated her. It was half
true and quite plausible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>When the light was bright and the street awake
I went out into the hall and waited. Miss Bliss was
the first person I caught, coming up from the street
door with a milk bottle. Her little face was full of
sleep that dispersed under my urgent murmurings.
She stepped inside the door and hailed tentatively:</p>

<p>“Hullo, Miss Harris.”</p>

<p>There was no answer and she ventured less buoyantly:</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel good, Miss Harris?”</p>

<p>The lack of response scared her, yet she stood fascinated
like the street gamin eying the victim of an
accident. She had seen enough to do what I wanted,
and I took her by the arm and pulled her into the
hall.</p>

<p>“She looks like she was dead,” she whispered,
awed. “Would you think a big husky woman like
that would take things so hard?”</p>

<p>I had prepared my lesson in the small hours and
answered glibly:</p>

<p>“She’s not half so strong as you think and very
sensitive, morbidly sensitive.”</p>

<p>“Um,” said Miss Bliss, “poor thing! I don’t see
how if she was so sensitive, she could have stood
that man Masters around so much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>She went down to dress and presently the news
percolated through the house. There was an opening
and shutting of doors and whisperings on the top
flight. Everybody stole up and offered help except
the count, who rose late to the summons of an alarm
clock. Mr. Hazard went across the street for the
doctor, met Mrs. Bushey on her way to physical
culture and sent her in.</p>

<p>I met her in the third-floor hall and we talked,
sitting on the banister. The count’s alarm clock had
evidently done its work, for he eyed us through the
crack of his door.</p>

<p>“How dreadful&mdash;terribly unfortunate,” Mrs.
Bushey muttered, then, looking about, caught the
count’s eye at the crack: “Good morning, Count
Delcati. You’re up early.”</p>

<p>The count responded, the gleaming eye large and
unwinking as if made of glass.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bushey’s glance returned to me. The smile
called forth by the greeting of the star lodger died
away.</p>

<p>“If her concert was such a failure and she’s sick,
how is she going to live?”</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought of that. It added a complication
to the already complex situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, she must have something,” I said with a
vaguely reassuringly air. “She hasn’t been making
money but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything positive of her financial
position?” interrupted Mrs. Bushey.</p>

<p>It was hard to be vague on any subject with Mrs.
Bushey, on the subject of finances impossible. She
listened to a few soothing sentences then said
grimly:</p>

<p>“I see you don’t really know anything about it.
Please try and find out. Of course I’m one of the
most kind-hearted people in the world, but”&mdash;she
held her physical culture manuals in the grip of one
elbow and extended her hands&mdash;“one must live. I
can’t be late with my rent whatever my lodgers
can be.”</p>

<p>The count’s voice issued unexpectedly through
the crack:</p>

<p>“I am late two times now and I still stay.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bushey smiled at the eye.</p>

<p>“Of course, Count Delcati, but you’re different.
I know all about you. But Miss Harris&mdash;a singer
who can’t make good. They’re notoriously bad pay.”
She turned sharply on me. “What seems to be the
matter with her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“Collapse,” I said promptly. “Complete collapse
and prostration.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bushey hitched the books into her armpit
and patted them in with her muff.</p>

<p>“Those are only words. I’m glad Mr. Hazard’s
gone for the doctor.” She turned and moved toward
the stair-head. “And if it’s anything contagious she
must go at once. Don’t keep her here five minutes.
The doctor’ll know where to send her.” She began
the descent. “If I’d only myself to think of I’d let
her stay if it was the bubonic plague. But I won’t
expose the rest of you to any danger.” She descended
the next flight and her voice grew fainter:
“I’m only thinking of you, my lodgers are always
my first consideration. If any of you got anything
I’d never forgive myself.” She reached the last
flight. “I wouldn’t expose one of you to contagion if
I never made a dollar or rented a room. That’s the
way I am. I know it’s foolish&mdash;you needn’t tell me
so, but&mdash;” The street door shut on her.</p>

<p>The doctor came with speed and an air of purpose.
At last he had somewhere to go when he ran down
the stairs with his bag, and it was difficult for him to
conceal his exhilaration. He was young, firm and
businesslike, examined Lizzie, asked questions and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>said it was “shock”. He was very anxious to find out
what had “precipitated the condition,” even read the
notices, and then sat with his chin in his hand looking
at the patient and frowning.</p>

<p>Out in the hall I enlarged on her high-strung organization
and he listened, fixing me with a searching
gaze that did not conceal the fact that he was
puzzled. We whispered on the landing over nursing,
food and the etceteras of illness, then branched
into shocks and their causes till he suddenly remembered
he had to be in a hurry, snatched up his bag
and darted away.</p>

<p>That was yesterday. To-night I have brought up
my writing things and while I watch am scratching
this off at the desk where, not so long ago, I found
her choosing her stage name. Poor Lizzie&mdash;is there
a woman who would refuse her pity?</p>

<p>I can run over the names of all those I know and
I don’t think there’s one, who, if she could look
through the sin at the sinner, would entirely condemn.
The worst of it is they all stop short at the
sin. It hides the personality behind it. I know if I
talked to Betty this way she’d say I was a silly
sentimentalist with no knowledge of life, for even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>my generous Betty wouldn’t see over the sin. There’s
something wrong with the way women appraise
“the values” in these matters; actions don’t stand in
the proper relations to character and intentions.
We’re all either sheep or goats. Everything that
makes our view-point, books, plays, precedent, public
opinion, will have it that we’re sheep or goats,
and though we can do a good many bad things and
remain pure spotless sheep, there’s just one thing
that if we do do, puts us forever in the corral with
the goats.</p>

<p>But, oh&mdash;I groan as I write it&mdash;if it only hadn’t
been Masters! That brute, that brigand! A hateful
thing some one once told me keeps surging up in
my memory&mdash;Rousseau said it I think&mdash;that one of
the best tests of character was the type of person
selected for love and friendship. I can’t get it out
of my head. What fool ever told it to me? Oh&mdash;all
of a sudden I remember&mdash;it was Roger&mdash;Roger! I
feel quite frightened when I think of him. He would
be so angry with me for being mixed up in such an
affair, or&mdash;as he’s never angry with me&mdash;angry with
fate for leading me into this <i>galère</i>. He is one of
the people who adhere to the sheep and goat theory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>To him women are black or white, and the white
ones must have the same relation to the black that
Voltaire had to <i>Le bon Dieu</i>&mdash;know them by sight
but not speak.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t is</span> three weeks since I have written a word.
There’s been too much to do, and sleeping about
in chairs and on the foot of beds is not stimulating
to the brain. We have had an anxious time, for Lizzie
Harris has been desperately ill. Doctor Vanderhoff&mdash;that’s
the young man’s name&mdash;has had no necessity
to run to the corner of Lexington Avenue and
then wonder which way to go, for he has been in
here a good deal of the time. He is a dear, and a
clever dear, too, for he has pulled Lizzie back from
dreadful dangers. For a while we didn’t think she
would ever be herself again. Her heart&mdash;but what’s
the sense of recapitulating past perils. She’s better,
that’s enough, and to-night I’m down in my apartment
leaving Miss Bliss in charge.</p>

<p>She’s another dear, poor little half-fed thing, running
back from her sittings to post up-stairs, panting
and frost nipped, and take her place in that still front
room. How still it’s been, with the long motionless
body on the bed, that wouldn’t speak and wouldn’t
eat, and hardly seemed to breathe. Sometimes the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>men came up and took a turn at the nursing. The
count was no use. The sight of her frightened him
and he had to be taken into the kitchen and given
whisky. But young Hazard was as good as a hospital
graduate, soft-handed and footed, better than
Mrs. Phillips, who came up once or twice between
her own cases, was very superior and nagged about
the sun-dial.</p>

<p>When he could, Mr. Hazard watched for the first
half of the night and Dolly Bliss and I went into the
kitchen and had supper of tea and eggs. We’ve
grown very intimate over these midnight meals. I
don’t see how she lives&mdash;ten dollars a week the most
she has made this winter, and often gaps without
work. One night I asked her if she had ever posed
for the altogether. Under normal circumstances I
would no more have put such a question than I’d
have inquired of Mrs. Bushey what she had done
with her husband. But with the specter of death at
our side, the reticences of every day have dropped
away.</p>

<p>She nodded, looking at me with large pathetic
eyes.</p>

<p>“Often in the past, but now, unfortunately, I’m
not in demand for that. I’m getting too thin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>In this close companionship I have found her generous,
unselfish and honest to the core. Is our modesty
an artificial attribute, grafted on us like a bud
to render us more alluring? This girl, struggling
against ferocious poverty, is as instinctively, as
rigorously virtuous as I am, as Betty, as Mrs. Ashworth,
yet she does a thing for her livelihood, the
thought of which would fill us with horror. I’m
going to put it to Betty, but I wouldn’t dare tell
her what I really think&mdash;that of the two points of
view Miss Bliss’ is the more modest.</p>

<p>When we were sure Lizzie was on the up-grade,
a new worry intruded&mdash;had she any independent
means? Nobody knew. Mrs. Bushey was urgent
and to keep her quiet I offered to pay the top-floor
rent for a month and found that the count had
already done it. I, who knew her best, feared she
had nothing, and it was “up to me” to get money
for her from somewhere.</p>

<p>Of course Betty was my natural prey and yesterday
afternoon fate rendered her into my hands.
She came to take me for a drive in a hansom, bringing
with her her youngest born, Henry Ferguson,
Junior, known familiarly as Wuzzy. Wuzzy is three,
fat, not talkative and spoiled. He wore a white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>bunny-skin coat, a hat with rosettes on his ears,
leather leggings and kid mitts tied round his wrists
with ribbons. He had so many clothes on that he
moved with difficulty, breathing audibly through his
nose. When he attempted to seat himself on the prie-dieu,
the only chair low enough to accommodate
him, he had to be bent in the middle like a jointed
doll.</p>

<p>I can not say that I love Wuzzy as much as I do
Constance. He is the heir of the Fergusons and the
conquering male is already apparent. It is plain to
be seen that he thinks women were made to administer
to his comfort and amuse him in his dull
moments. I have memories of taking care of Wuzzy
last autumn at Betty’s country place when his nurse
was off duty. I never worked so hard in my life.
Half the energy and imagination expended in what
the newspapers call a “gainful occupation” would
have made me one of those women of whom <i>The
Ladies’ Home Journal</i> prints biographies.</p>

<p>I carried him down-stairs. It was not necessary,
for dangling from the maternal hand he could have
been dragged along, but there is something so nice
about hugging a healthy, warm, little bundle of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>boy. As I bent for him he held up his arms with a
bored expression, then stiff and upright against my
shoulder, looked down the staircase and yawned.
It’s the utter confidence of a child that makes it so
charming. Wuzzy relinquished himself to my care
as if, when it came to carrying a baby down-stairs,
I was the expert of the western world.</p>

<p>As we descended I rubbed my cheek against his,
satin-smooth, cold and firm. He drew back and
gazed at me, a curiously deep look, impersonal, profound.
The human being soon loses the capacity
for that look. It only belongs to the state when
we are still “trailing clouds of glory.”</p>

<p>We squeezed him between us and tooled away
toward Fifth Avenue. It was a glorious afternoon
and it was glorious to be out again, to breathe the
keen sharp air, to see the park trees in a thin
purplish mist of branch on branch. Wuzzy, seeing
little boys and girls on roller skates, suddenly
pounded on us with his heels and had to be lifted to
a prominent position on our knees, whence he leaned
over the door and beat gently on the air with his
kid mitts.</p>

<p>“What a bother this child is,” sighed Betty, boosting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
him up, “I only brought him because I had to.
Some relation of his nurse is sick and she went out
to see them.”</p>

<p>Her only son is the object of Mrs. Ferguson’s
passionate adoration, yet she always speaks of him
as if he was her greatest cross.</p>

<p>Wuzzy comfortable, his attention concentrated on
the moving show, I brought my subject on the carpet.</p>

<p>“Dear me, how dreadful,” Betty murmured, much
moved by the expurgated version of Lizzie Harris’
troubles. “Wuzzy, if you don’t stop kicking me with
your heels I’ll take you home.”</p>

<p>Wuzzy stopped kicking, throwing himself far
over the door to follow the flight of a golden-locked
fairy in brown velvet. We held him by his rear
draperies and talked across his back.</p>

<p>“It’s a cruel situation,” I answered. “Everything
has failed the poor creature.”</p>

<p>“She has no means of livelihood at all?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure yet, but I don’t think so. As soon
as she’s well enough I’ll find out. Meantime there’s
this illness, the doctor&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” Betty interrupted, “I know all that.
But it needn’t bother you. I’ll attend to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Dear Betty!” I let go of Wuzzy to stretch a hand
across to her.</p>

<p>“Now, <i>don’t</i> be sentimental, Evie. This is the sort
of thing I like doing. If I could find some one&mdash;”</p>

<p>The prospects suddenly palled on Wuzzy and he
threw himself violently back and lay supine between
us, gazing up at the trap.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, why did I bring him,” groaned
his mother. “I wouldn’t take care of a child like
this for millions of dollars. Why <i>do</i> nurses have sick
relations? There ought to be a special breed raised
without a single human tie. Get up, Wuzzy.”</p>

<p>She tugged at his arm, but he continued to stare
upward, inert as a flour sack.</p>

<p>“What does he see up there?” I said, bending my
head back to try and locate the object. “Perhaps it’s
something we can take down and give him.”</p>

<p>“You can’t unless you break the hansom to pieces.
It’s the trap.”</p>

<p>I felt of it. Wuzzy’s eyes followed my hand with
a trance-like intentness and he emitted a low sound
of approval.</p>

<p>At that moment, as though fate pitied our helplessness,
the trap flew back and a section of red
face filled the aperture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“Is it straight down the avenue I’m to go, Mrs.
Ferguson?” came a cheerful bass. “You ain’t told
me.”</p>

<p>Wuzzy looked, flinched, his pink face puckered
and a cry of mortal fear burst from him. He
clutched us with his mitts and wrenched himself to a
sitting posture, then, determined to shut out the
horrible vision, leaned as far over the door as he
could and forgot all about it. Betty gave directions
and we sped along into the line of carriages by
Sherman’s statue. We had to wait there, and a
policeman with gesticulating arms and a whistle
caught Wuzzy’s attention. He waved a friendly mitt
at him, muttering low comments to himself. His
mother patted his little hunched-up back and took
up the broken thread:</p>

<p>“What was I saying? Oh, yes&mdash;if I could get
some one who would hunt up such cases as Miss Harris’
and report them to me I’d pay them a good
salary. Those are the people one never hears about,
unless in some accidental way like this.”</p>

<p>The policeman whistled and we moved forward. I
began to feel uncomfortable. I’d never before told
Betty half a story. She went on:</p>

<p>“Of course there’s charity on a large scale, organized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
and all that. But the hundreds of decent
people who get into dreadful positions and are too
proud to ask for aid, are the ones I’d like to help.
Especially girls, good, hard-working, honest girls.”</p>

<p>In my embarrassment I fingered Wuzzy’s ear-rosette.
He resented the familiarity and angrily
brushed my hand away.</p>

<p>“Oh, do let him alone,” said his mother. “You
can’t tell how he’ll break out if he gets cross&mdash;and
I know Miss Harris is all that, in spite of her hat and
her looks, or you wouldn’t be so friendly with her.”</p>

<p>“Charity given to her is charity given where it’s
needed,” I muttered with a red face.</p>

<p>I felt wretchedly underhanded and mean, and
that’s one of the most unbearable feelings for a self-respecting
woman to endure. For one reckless moment
I thought of telling Betty the whole story. And
then I knew I mustn’t. I couldn’t make her understand.
I couldn’t translate Lizzie into the terms with
which Mrs. Ferguson was familiar. I saw that
broken woman emerging from my narrative a
smirched and bespattered pariah of the kind that,
from time immemorial, ladies have regarded as their
hereditary foe.</p>

<p>It would have been indulging my conscience at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>her expense, and my conscience&mdash;well, it had to
resign its job for the present. It was odd that with
a worthy intention and in connection with one of
the best of women, I felt my only course was to
deceive. All may have been well with Pippa’s world,
but certainly all was not well with mine. I don’t
know what was wrong, only that something was.
I know I should have been able to tell the truth, I
<i>know</i> I ought not to have been made to feel a coward
and a sneak.</p>

<p>Betty enlarged upon her scheme of benefaction
and we drove down the avenue, full from curb to
curb and glittering in its afternoon prime. Wuzzy
was much entertained, leaning forward to eye passing
horses and call greetings to dogs on the front
seats of motors. Once when he needed feminine attention
he turned to me, remarking commandingly,
“Wipe my nose.” As I performed this humble service
he remained motionless, his eyes raised in abstraction
to a church clock. I have heard many people
envy the care-free condition of childhood and
wish they were babes again. I never could agree
with them; the very youthful state has always
seemed to me a much overrated period. But as I
obeyed Wuzzy’s command it suddenly came upon me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>how delightful it would be to be so utterly free of responsibility,
so unperplexed by ethical problems, so
completely dependent, that even the wiping of one’s
nose was left to other hands.</p>

<p>I left Lizzie early that evening. Miss Bliss and
Mr. Hazard were with her and I had a fancy they
liked being together without me sitting about and
overhearing. I pulled a chair up in front of the
fire and mused over that question of taking Betty’s
money. My discharged conscience was homesick and
wanted to come back. In the midst of my musing
Roger came in, and presently, he and I sitting one
on either side of the grate, it occurred to me that he
would be a good person to put in the place of my
conscience&mdash;get his opinion on the vexed question
and not let him know it. I would do it so cleverly
he’d never guess and I could abide in his decision.
Excellent idea!</p>

<p>“Roger,” I began in a simple earnest tone, “I
want to ask you about a question of ethics, and I
want you to give me your full attention.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Roger, putting a foot on the
fender. “I’m not an authority, but I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I knew a woman&mdash;no, a man’s better&mdash;who
was, well, we’ll say a thief, not a habitual thief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>but one who had thieved once, got into bad company
and been led away. And I happened to know he
wanted help&mdash;financial&mdash;to tide him over a period of
want. Would I be doing something underhanded if
I asked some one&mdash;let’s say you&mdash;to give him the
money and didn’t tell you about the thieving?”</p>

<p>I thought I had done it rather well. Roger was
interested.</p>

<p>“Are you supposed to know for certain he’d only
committed the one offense?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” with conviction.</p>

<p>“What made him do it?”</p>

<p>It wasn’t so easy as I thought. Theft didn’t seem
to fit the case.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;he was tempted, and&mdash;er&mdash;didn’t seem
to have as strict a moral standard as most people.”</p>

<p>“Um,” Roger considered, then: “This seems to
be a complicated case. Was he completely without
will, no force, no character?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I said sharply. “He had a great deal
of will and any amount of character.”</p>

<p>“He sounds like a dangerous criminal&mdash;plenty of
force and will and no moral standard.”</p>

<p>I felt irritated and raised my voice in a combative
note:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Roger, don’t be narrow-minded. Can’t
you imagine quite a fine person who mightn’t think
stealing as wrong as you or I think it?”</p>

<p>Roger did not look irritated, but he looked determined
and spoke with an argumentative firmness:</p>

<p>“Evie, I’ve always regarded you as an unusually
intelligent woman. As such I’d like you to explain
to me how a fine person of will and character can
steal and not think it as wrong as you or I would
think it.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t working out as I expected and because
it wasn’t and because Roger was giving it his full
attention, I felt more irritated.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you he’d fallen into bad company?”</p>

<p>“You did and I’ve taken it into consideration,
but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Roger, this isn’t a legal investigation. You’re
not trying to break up the beef trust or impose a
fine on Standard Oil. It’s just a simple question
of right and wrong.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think it’s simple. This person
with any amount of character fell under a bad influence?”</p>

<p>“That’s it&mdash;he was undermined, and though he
was, as I said, a fine person, quite noble in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>respects, he didn’t think stealing was so wicked as
the average respectable citizen does.”</p>

<p>Roger put the other foot on the fender and looked
at me with increasing concentration.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand at all. Let me try and get
to the bottom of it. What did he steal?”</p>

<p>For a moment I stared at him blankly without
answering.</p>

<p>He went on. There was no doubt about his giving
me his full attention, it was getting fuller every
moment.</p>

<p>“If you’ll tell me the nature of his theft and under
what provocation and circumstances it was committed
maybe I’ll be able to get a better idea of the
kind of person he was. What did he steal?”</p>

<p>“But, Roger, this is a hypothetical case.”</p>

<p>“I know it is, but that doesn’t make any difference
in the answer. What was the nature of the theft&mdash;money,
jewels, grafting on a large scale, or taking
an apple from the grocer’s barrel?”</p>

<p>I looked around the room in desperation, saw the
blank left on the wall by the Marie Antoinette
mirror, and said doggedly:</p>

<p class="p2b">“He stole a mirror.”</p>

<p class="caption">“Let me try and get at the bottom of it”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“A mirror,” said Roger with the air of having
extracted an important bit of evidence. “Umph&mdash;
Why did he take it?”</p>

<p>“Roger, what’s the sense of going into all these
details?”</p>

<p>“Evie,” with maddening obstinacy, all the more
maddening because it was so mild, “if I’m to give
an answer I must know. Did he intend to sell it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did.”</p>

<p>I was so angry that I felt ready to defend any one
who stole anything from anybody.</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” said Roger, still mild but also
reproachful, “how can you sit there and tell me that
a man who steals a mirror intending to sell it is a
fine person, quite noble in some respects?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. I won’t. I asked you a simple
question about a man&mdash;a man I just made up&mdash;and
you cross-examine me as if I was being tried
for murder and you were the lawyer on the other
side.”</p>

<p>“But, Evie, I only was trying to do what you
asked.”</p>

<p>“Well, stop trying. Let that man and his mirror
drop or I’ll lose my temper.” I snatched up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>poker and began to poke the fire. “I’ve lost it now.”
I poked furiously in illustration. “It’s too aggravating.
I did so want your opinion about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, here it is&mdash;”</p>

<p>I stopped poking and leaned forward, so far forward
that to keep my balance I had to put a foot on
the fender.</p>

<p>“Has one a right to accept pecuniary aid for a
person who has committed an offense&mdash;the first&mdash;without
telling the benefactor of that offense? Is
that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I think one has.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure they needn’t tell the benefactor?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t. If you want to give a man a hand-up
why rake up his past?”</p>

<p>I got it at last. My bad temper vanished. I
was wreathed in smiles&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, Roger,” I cried joyously, “that’s just what
I wanted you to say. It’s such a relief that we’ve
worked it out at last,” and I heaved a sigh and put
the other foot on the fender.</p>

<p>I sat for a moment, absently looking down, then
I became conscious of my feet, side by side on the
brass rail&mdash;two small patent leather points. I looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>along the rail and there on the other side were
Roger’s&mdash;two large patent leather points. They
looked like four small black animals, perched in
couples, sociably warming themselves by the blaze.</p>

<p>“What are you smiling at?” said Roger.</p>

<p>“How near we came to quarreling over an imaginary
man stealing an imaginary mirror,” said I.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">L</span>izzie</span> is coming to life, hesitatingly and as if
with reluctance. I suppose it’s natural for her
to be extraordinarily weak, but I never would have
believed she could be conscious enough to talk and
so utterly indifferent to everything that should concern
her. When I told her about the money, saying
it came from a friend, she murmured, “That’s all
right,” and never asked who the friend was. She
seemed to have no interest in the subject, or in any
subject, for that matter. She makes me think of
a brilliant, highly colored plant that a large stone
has fallen on.</p>

<p>One afternoon last week, when I was sitting by
the table in her room reading, she suddenly spoke.</p>

<p>“Evie, how long is it that I’ve been sick here?”</p>

<p>“Nearly a month. You’ve been very ill, but
you’re getting better now every day.”</p>

<p>She said no more and I got up and began moving
about the room, arranging it for the evening. I was
pulling down the blinds when I heard her stirring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>and looking back, saw that she had twisted about
in the bed and was watching me. In the dusk, her
face, framed in elf locks of black hair, looked like
a white mask. I thought she was going to ask me
something&mdash;there was a question in her eyes&mdash;but
she made no sound. I lighted the lamp and shifted
into place the paper rose that hung from the shade.
She continued to follow my movements with the intent
observation of an animal. I have seen dogs
watch their masters just that way. The feeling that
something was on her mind grew stronger. I went to
her and sat on the side of the bed.</p>

<p>“Do you want to ask me anything?” I said.</p>

<p>She shook her head, but her eyes were unquiet.
Suddenly I thought I guessed. I put my hand on
hers and spoke very low.</p>

<p>“Lizzie, the thing you told me that night when I
came up and found you here”&mdash;I looked into her
face to see if she understood&mdash;“I’ve never told to
anybody.”</p>

<p>She stared at me without answering.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I mean?”</p>

<p>She gave a slight affirmative nod.</p>

<p>“And I never will tell it to any one unless you
ask me to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“<i>I</i> don’t care if you tell it,” she said with weak
indifference.</p>

<p>It was the first gleam of her old self. Whatever
she had wanted to say to me it was not that. Other
women&mdash;the women of my world&mdash;would have been
fearful of their secret lightly guarded. I don’t believe
she had given it a thought. Either her trust
in me was implicit or she didn’t care who knew
it. I like to think it was the first.</p>

<p>She settled back against the pillow and made
feeble smoothings of the sheet. Still persuaded of
her inward disquiet I sat silent waiting for her to
speak. After a moment or two she did.</p>

<p>“Have any letters come for me?”</p>

<p>I knew <i>this</i> was the question. I got up and gave
her the pile of letters stacked on the desk. She
looked over the addresses, then pushed them back to
me.</p>

<p>“I was afraid he might write to me,” she said.
“But it’s all right, he hasn’t.”</p>

<p>I got a shock of displeased surprise.</p>

<p>“You didn’t expect him to <i>write</i> to you, Lizzie?”</p>

<p>“He might have.”</p>

<p>“But after&mdash;after what you told me, surely, oh,
surely, you don’t want to hear from him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>I was fearful of her answer. If she was waiting,
hungering for a letter from him, it would have been
too much even for me.</p>

<p>“That’s just it&mdash;I <i>don’t</i> want to. It’s all in the
past, as if it had happened a hundred years ago. I
want it to stay there&mdash;to be dead.”</p>

<p>She looked into my eyes, a deep look, that for
some inexplicable reason reminded me of Wuzzy’s.
I have long realized that my point of view, my
mental processes, are too remote from hers for me
ever to see into her mind or understand its workings.
But I was certain that she meant what she said.
My poor Lizzie, coming up out of the Valley of the
Shadow, with her feeble feet planted on the past.</p>

<p>A few days after this she was well enough to sit
up in bed with her hair brushed and braided, and
read her letters. One was from Vignorol asking her
why she had not come for her lessons.</p>

<p>She gave it to me, remarking:</p>

<p>“I wish you’d answer that. Tell him I’ve been
sick, and that I’ll never come for any more lessons.”</p>

<p>I dropped my sewing, making the round eyes
of astonishment with which I greet her unexpected
decisions.</p>

<p>“You’re not thinking of giving up your singing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, forever.”</p>

<p>“But why? Surely you’re not going to let one
failure discourage you.”</p>

<p>I was disturbed. From a few recent remarks, I
am satisfied that she has no means whatever. She
<i>must</i> go on with her singing; as Mrs. Bushey would
say, “One must live.” She could curb her ambitions,
make her living on a less brilliant plane.</p>

<p>“I’ll never sing again,” she answered.</p>

<p>“You might give up attempting the opera, or even
concerts. But there are so many other things you
could do. Church singing&mdash;you began that way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. I began, and I’m not going back
to where I began. I’m going on or I’m going to
stop. And I can’t go on.”</p>

<p>I thought she alluded to her lack of means and
said:</p>

<p>“Lizzie, I can get the money for you to go back to
Vignorol&mdash;I can get people who will stand behind
you and give you every chance.”</p>

<p>She looked listlessly at the wall and shook her
head.</p>

<p>“It’s no use. I don’t want it. Masters was right.
I know it now.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;” I stopped; it seemed too cruel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>But she was minded now to be as ruthlessly clear-sighted
about herself as she had once been obstinately
blind.</p>

<p>“The whole equipment&mdash;I haven’t got it. He
banked too much on my looks, thought they were
going to go farther than they did. If I’d had a
great voice&mdash;one of the wonderful voices of the
world, like Patti or Melba&mdash;it wouldn’t have mattered
about not having the rest. But there are
hundreds with voices as good as mine. He thought
beauty and dramatic instinct were going to carry
me through. He knew I had the one and he thought
he could give me the other&mdash;train it into me. Nobody
knows how hard he tried. He used to make
me stand up and go over every gesture after him,
he even made marks on the floor where I was to put
my feet. And then he’d sit down and hold his
head and groan. Poor Jack”&mdash;she gave a little dry
laugh&mdash;“he had an awful time!”</p>

<p>I could realize something of Masters’ desperation.
To have discovered a song-bird in the western wilds,
hoped to retrieve his fortunes with it and then found
a defect in its mechanism that neither work nor
brains nor patience could supply&mdash;it <i>was</i> bitter luck.</p>

<p>“He was an artist,” she went on. “He could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>have gone straight to the top but he lost his voice
after the first few years, while he was still touring
the small European towns.”</p>

<p>I noticed that she spoke in the past tense, her tone
one of melancholy reminiscence as if he really <i>was</i>
dead. She might have been delivering his funeral
sermon and placing flowers of memory on his tomb.</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t you have got from him what he
tried to teach you? I can’t understand, you’re so
intelligent.”</p>

<p>She mused for a moment, then said:</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking of that myself while I’ve been
lying here. Looking back I don’t seem to have given
it my full mind and I’ve been wondering if perhaps
I wasn’t too taken up with him. I couldn’t get away
from the real romance, the love-making and the
quarrels, first one and then the other. There wasn’t
anything else in my life. I hadn’t time to be interested
in those women I had to pretend to be. My
affairs and me were the only things that counted.”</p>

<p>“But you were so much in earnest, so desperately
anxious to succeed.”</p>

<p>She gave me a side look, sharp and full of
meaning.</p>

<p>“Because, though I wouldn’t acknowledge it, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>knew he wanted to break with me and the only
way I could keep him was to make good.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, how horrible!” I winced under
her pitiless plain speaking.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was,” she said gently.</p>

<p>There was a pause. The little palliatives I had to
offer, the timid consolations, were shriveled up by
that fierce and uncompromising candor. Her voice
broke the silence, quietly questioning:</p>

<p>“I suppose you think I did a very bad thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lizzie, don’t ask me that. I can’t sit in
judgment. That’s for you, not for me.”</p>

<p>She looked at her hands, long and thin on the
quilt. Thus down-drooped, her face was shockingly
haggard and wasted. Yet of the storm which had
caused this ruin she was now speaking with a
cold impersonal calm, as if it had all happened to
somebody else. My own emotions that swelled to
passionate expression died away before that inscrutable
and baffling indifference.</p>

<p>“He was a very fine man,” she said suddenly.</p>

<p>“<i>Fine?</i>” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, in lots of ways. About his art and work
for one thing&mdash;he had great ideals. And he was
very good to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>That was the coping stone. I heard myself saying
in a faint voice:</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, he never lied to me. He
told the truth about the singing, about me, about
everything. He wasn’t a coward, either. He didn’t
run away and send me a letter. He came and had it
out with me, made me understand.”</p>

<p>This time I couldn’t speak. Her next words were
like the laying of the final wreath on the bier of
the loved and respected dead:</p>

<p>“It had to end and he ended it. He didn’t care
how much it hurt me, or what I felt, or what anybody
thought. That’s the right way to be&mdash;not to
let other people’s feelings make you afraid, not to
be considerate because it’s easier than fighting it out.
He was a fine man.”</p>

<p>That was John Masters’ obituary as delivered by
his discarded mistress.</p>

<p>The thing I couldn’t get over was that she showed
no signs of penitence. As far as I could see she was
in no way inclined to admit her fault, to bow her
head and say, “I have sinned.” Her own conduct in
the affair seemed to be the last thing that troubled
her. Yet I can say that I, a woman with the traditional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
moral views, could not think her either abandoned
or base. I don’t know to what world or creed
she belonged, or to what ethical code she adhered,
except that it was not mine or anybody else’s that I
have ever known. Whatever it was it seemed to
uphold her in her course. What was done was
done and that was the end of it. No strugglings of
inner irresolution, no attempt to exonerate or exculpate,
disturbed her somberly steadfast poise. What
would have been admirable to any one was her
acceptance of the blow, and her recognition of her
lover’s right to deliver it.</p>

<p>As she improved, moved about the room and took
her place against accustomed backgrounds, I began
to realize that the change in her was more than skin
deep. Her wild-fire was quenched, her moods, her
beamings, her flashes of anger were gone. A wistful
passivity had taken their place, lovely but alien to
her who was once Lizzie Harris. Whatever Masters
had said in that last interview had acted like an
extinguisher on a bright and dancing flame. It
made me think of Dean Swift and Vanessa. Nobody
knows what the dean said to Esther Vanhomrigh
in the arbor among the little trees&mdash;only she had
returned from it a broken thing to die soon after.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>Her lover had killed her; Lizzie’s had not quite,
but he had certainly put out the light in that wayward
and rebellious spirit.</p>

<p>It has its good points, for those people who are
to help her find her more comprehensible, much
more to their liking than they would the old Lizzie.
Roger, for example, has met her again and is quite
impressed. It was the other afternoon when I was
sitting with her in her front room. The door was
open and as I talked I listened for steps that would
stop two flights below at <i>my</i> door. I had had no
word that steps might be expected, but one doesn’t
always need the word. There are mornings when a
woman wakes and says to herself, “He’ll come to-day.”
It had been one of these mornings.</p>

<p>At five, when the lights were lit and I had put on
the tea water to boil, I heard the ascending feet.
If it was some one for me could I bring them up?
Lizzie would be delighted. I ran down and found
him standing at my door preparing to knock with
the head of his cane. Would he mind coming up&mdash;I
didn’t like to leave her too much alone? No,
he wouldn’t, and up he came.</p>

<p>Lizzie, long and limp in the easy chair, was
sheltered from the lamp glow by the paper rose.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>She smiled and held out her hand and I saw he was
shocked by the change in her, as well he might be.
The only other time he had seen her was the night
of the concert, the climax of that little day to which
every dog of us is entitled.</p>

<p>All things that are frail and feeble appeal to
Roger. Both he and Mrs. Ashworth get stiff and
ice-bound before bumptious, full-fed, prosperous
people. He sat down beside her and made himself
very agreeable. And I was pleased, immensely
pleased; could better endure the thought of Lizzie
like a smashed flower if by her smashing she was
to win his approval and interest.</p>

<p>As I made the tea I could hear their voices rising
and falling. Coming up the passage with the tray
the doorway framed them like a picture and I
stopped and gazed admiringly. It was like the
cover of a ten-cent magazine&mdash;a graceful woman
and a personable man conversing elegantly in a
gush of lamplight. The lamplight was necessary
to the illusion, for it hid Roger’s wrinkles and made
his gray hair look fair. He could easily have
passed for the smooth-shaven, high-collared wooer,
and Lizzie, languidly reclining with listening eyes,
quite fittingly filled the rôle of wooee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>
<p>An hour afterward, as we went down-stairs,
Roger was silent till we got to my door. Then he
said:</p>

<p>“She seems very different from what she was that
night when I saw her in your room.”</p>

<p>“She is different. You don’t seem to realize
she’s been very sick.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;but&mdash;”</p>

<p>I pushed open the door.</p>

<p>“Roger, aren’t you coming in?”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I can’t. I’m going out to dinner and
I have to go home and change.”</p>

<p>I was disappointed, but I wouldn’t have shown
it for the world. I couldn’t help thinking it was
rather stupid of him not to have made a move to
get away sooner, to have a moment’s talk in my
parlor by my lamplight.</p>

<p>“From what you told me of her I thought she was
rather high-pitched and western.”</p>

<p>“I <i>never</i> said that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you didn’t, but somehow I got the impression.
She’s anything but that&mdash;delicate, fine.”</p>

<p>“Um,” I responded. These positive opinions on
a person I knew so much better than he did rasped
me a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>Roger shifted his hat to his left hand and moved
to the stair-head.</p>

<p>“There’s something very unusual about her, a
sort of fragile simplicity like a dogrose. Good-by,
Evie. Good night.”</p>

<p>I went into my room. It was cold and the chill
of it struck uncomfortably on me. I had a queer
feeling of being suddenly flat&mdash;spiritually&mdash;as a
flourishing lawn might feel when a new roller goes
over it. It improves the looks of the lawn. That it
didn’t have the same effect on me I noticed when
I caught myself in the chimneypiece glass. What
a dim little colorless dib of a woman I was! And
how particularly dim and colorless a dib I must look
beside Lizzie.</p>

<p>I got my supper, feeling aggrieved. I had never
before accused fate of being unfair when it forgot
to make me pretty. But now I felt hurt, meanly
discriminated against. It wasn’t just to give one
woman shining soulful eyes, set deep under classic
brows, and another small gray-green ones that said
nothing and grew red in a high wind. It wasn’t
a square deal.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon Betty turned up and found
the invalid sitting in my steamer chair looking at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>the juniper bush. Betty had never spoken to her
before and they talked amicably, Mrs. Ferguson
visibly thawing. I left them, for I want Betty to
know her and help her of her own free will, want
to eliminate myself as the middleman.</p>

<p>I was in the kitchenette, getting tea again, when
Betty came to the door and hissed her impressions
in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me she was so charming?”</p>

<p>Business with the kettle.</p>

<p>“She’s one of the sweetest creatures I ever met.”</p>

<p>Business with the hot water.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I ever thought she looked
theatrical. She must have had on somebody else’s
clothes. She’s a Madonna&mdash;those eyes and that sad
far-away look.”</p>

<p>Business with the toast.</p>

<p>Betty was so interested that she got into the
kitchenette with me. The congestion was extreme,
especially as she takes up so much room and is so
hard. You can’t squeeze by her or flatten her
against walls&mdash;you might as well try to flatten a
Corinthian column. I had to feel round her for
cups and plates, engirdle her glistening and prosperous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
bulk and grope about on the shelves behind
her.</p>

<p>“It’s absurd of her fooling about with this music.
She ought to marry. Has she any serious admirer?”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t any woman who looked like that have
serious admirers? Betty, I can’t find the cups.
Would you mind moving an inch or two?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind at all if there was an inch or
two to move in to. When you have a kitchen like
this you’re evidently expected to hire your maid
by measure. Who’s her admirer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, every man in the house.”</p>

<p>“Are any of them possible?”</p>

<p>I pried her back from the stove and inserted
myself between her and it, feeling like a flower
being pressed in the leaves of a book.</p>

<p>“No, not very possible.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to see what I can do.”</p>

<p>As I poured the water on the tea I couldn’t help
saying over my shoulder:</p>

<p>“There’s Mr. Albertson. He’s still unclaimed in
the ‘Found’ Department.”</p>

<p>Mr. Albertson hadn’t loved me at first sight and
Betty feels rather sore about it. She drew a deep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>breath, thereby crushing me against the front of
the stove.</p>

<p>“No,” she said consideringly. “He won’t do.
He’s too old and too matter-of-fact. Besides, I want
him for one of the Geary girls, my second cousins,
who live up in the Bronx and make shoe bags.
I’m not sure which he’ll like best, so to-morrow night
I’m having them both to dine with him.”</p>

<p>Then we had tea and Betty’s good impression
increased. She went away whispering to me on the
stairs that she was quite ready to tide Miss Harris
over her difficulties and help her when she had decided
what she wanted to do.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> weather is fine and we are all recuperating.
I must confess the physical and spiritual
storm of the last six weeks has rather laid me waste.
I haven’t felt so much in so many ways since&mdash;well,
my high water mark was the last year of my married
life and that’s getting to be a faded canvas.
The metaphor is somewhat mixed, but if I draw attention
to it it can pass. I’m like that letter-writing
English woman who couldn’t spell, and when she
was doubtful about a word always underlined it
and if it was wrong it passed for a joke.</p>

<p>We sit about a good deal in my front room and
late in the afternoon Lizzie’s admirers drop in. The
doctor, by the way, is one of them. He says he’s
still interested in “the case,” poor young man. Lizzie
greets them with wistful softness and seems as indifferent
to their homage as if they were pictures
hanging on the wall. I talk to them, and while we
talk we are acutely conscious of her, singularly
dominated by her compelling presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>In all the change in her that quality is as strong
as ever. I do not yet know what it is that makes
her the focusing point of everybody’s attention, but
that she is, nobody who has lived in this house could
deny. I believe actresses are trained to “take the
stage and hold it,” but Lizzie has the faculty as a
birthright. It is not her looks; I have seen hundreds
of women who were as handsome as she and
had no such ascendency. It is not the high-handed
way she imposes her personality upon every one, because
she doesn’t do that any more. It is not her
serene self-absorption, her unconscious ignoring of
<i>your</i> little claims to be a person of importance. It’s
something so powerful no one can escape it, and so
subtle no one can define it&mdash;some sort of magnetic
force that puts her always in the center, makes
her presence felt like an unescapable sound or a
penetrating light. Wherever she is she is “it.”
“Where the MacGregor sits there is the head of the
table.”</p>

<p>Wednesday afternoon in the slack hours&mdash;the rush
hours are from five to seven, when the men come
home from business&mdash;Mrs. Stregazzi, the eldest
small Stregazzi and Mr. Berwick dropped in. They
had just heard of her illness and came to make inquiries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Berwick explained this because Mrs. Stregazzi
couldn’t. In a large, black lynx turban that
looked like Robinson Crusoe’s hat, and a long plush
coat, she dropped on the end of the sofa tapping her
chest in explanatory pantomime and fetching loud
breaths from the bottom of her lungs.</p>

<p>Berwick looked morosely at her, then explained:</p>

<p>“It’s cigarettes&mdash;cuts her wind.”</p>

<p>“It’s my new corset,” Mrs. Stregazzi shot out between
gasps, “and your stairs.”</p>

<p>The small Stregazzi, a little pale girl of ten, eyed
her mother for a considering moment, then apparently
satisfied with her symptoms, sat down on
the prie-dieu and heaving a deep sigh, folded her
hands in her lap and assumed a patient expression.</p>

<p>Lizzie’s illness disposed of, the conversation
turned&mdash;no, jumped, leaped, sprang&mdash;into that
world of plays and concerts in which they had their
beings. Mrs. Stregazzi, though still having trouble
with her “wind,” launched forth into a description
of the concert tour she and Berwick were to
take through New England. Berwick had made a
hit at Lizzie’s concert and he’d “got his chance at
last.”</p>

<p>I sat aside and marveled at her. She must have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>been forty years old and she looked as weather-beaten
as if, for twenty of the forty years, she had
been the figurehead of a ship. But vigor and enthusiasm
breathed from her. With the Robinson
Crusoe hat slipped to one side of her head and the
new corsets emitting protesting creaks as she swayed
toward me, she gasped out the route, the terms, the
programs, then dabbing at the little girl with her
muff, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“And the kids are going to stay with mommer
in the Bronx. Mrs. Drake, I’ve got the cutest little
flat at One Hundred and Sixty-ninth Street. Wish
you’d go up there some day and you’ll see the best
pair of children and the grandest old lady in Manhattan.”</p>

<p>Berwick growled an assent and Miss Stregazzi,
with her air of polite patience, filled in while her
mother caught her breath.</p>

<p>“Grandma’s seventy-two. She used to sing in the
opera chorus, but she’s got too old.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stregazzi nodded confirmation, her eyes full
of pride.</p>

<p>“That’s the way she pulled me along and got my
education. Didn’t let go of the rudder till I could
take hold. Now I do it. It’s been a struggle, took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>me into vaudeville, where I met Stregazzi and had
my troubles, but they’re over now. I’m back where
I belong and mommer can rest, blessed old soul. I
keep them pretty snug, don’t I, Dan?”</p>

<p>Berwick gave a second growl and then the conversation
swung back to the inevitable topic. I felt
as if I were on a scenic railway on a large scale, being
rushed perilously along with wild drivings
through space, varied by breathless stoppages in
strange towns. I never heard so much geography
since my school-days or so much scandal since I
came to the age when I could listen to my elders.
Names I knew well and names I’d never heard
jostled one another in those flying sentences, and
the quarrels! <i>and</i> the divorces! <span class="allsmcap">AND</span> the love-affairs!
I looked uneasily at the little girl and caught her
in the act of yawning. In proof of her grandmother’s
good training she concealed her mouth with
a very small hand in a very dirty white glove. Her
mother ended a graphic account of the trials of a
tertium quid on the road:</p>

<p>“And he pulled a kodak from under his coat and
snapped them just in the middle of the kiss. <i>That</i>
divorce wasn’t contested.”</p>

<p>The little girl, having accomplished her yawn,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>dropped her hand and said without interest, but
as one who feels good manners demand some sort
of comment:</p>

<p>“Whose divorce?”</p>

<p>“No one you know, honey. A lady I toured with
two seasons ago.”</p>

<p>Lizzie and Berwick listened. I had never heard
him do anything else. Before I came to live here
if I had been told of the excellence of his vocal performance
and then seen him I would have shaken
my head and said: “That’s not the man.” A winter
at Mrs. Bushey’s has taught me that the artist does
not have a brand upon his brow like Cain.</p>

<p>His listening was of a glowering unresponsive
kind; Lizzie’s was all avid attention. It was the
first time since her illness that she had shown any
animation. A faint color came into her face, now
and then she halted Mrs. Stregazzi’s flow of words
with a sharp question. The projected tour was the
thing that absorbed her. She kept pulling Mrs.
Stregazzi out of the scandals back to it. There was
no envy in her interest. It was to me extremely pathetic,
she, the failure, speeding Berwick on his way
to success. As might have been expected he was
stolidly indifferent to it, but I was amazed to see that
Mrs. Stregazzi, whom I was beginning to like, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>untouched or was too engrossed in her own affairs
to notice anything else.</p>

<p>Outside at the head of the staircase she paused,
and giving a glance at the closed door, said in a lowered
voice:</p>

<p>“Where’s Masters?”</p>

<p>Berwick had gone on ahead, the little girl with
her arm hooked over the banister was slowly descending.
Mrs. Stregazzi’s eye, holding mine, was
intelligent and questioning. I saw that she knew
and took it for granted that I did.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t come any more. They’ve had a difference&mdash;a
quarrel, I think.”</p>

<p>“Left her!” She raised her painted eyebrows, and
compressing her lips, looked down the stairs and
emitted a low “Umph!”</p>

<p>A world of meaning was in that sound, a deep
understanding pity.</p>

<p>“I thought he’d do it,” she said, as if speaking to
herself. “She couldn’t hold him the way things
were going.”</p>

<p>She stood musing, her head slightly drooped.
The Robinson Crusoe hat changed its angle and slid
down over her forehead. When the fur interfered
with her vision she arrested its progress, ramming
it violently back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“I guess she feels pretty bad,” she ruminated, still
with the effect of thinking aloud. “That man’s got
a terribly taking way with women.”</p>

<p>I felt very uncomfortable. If it was unnecessary
to contradict her it was also unnecessary to admit
her charges by receiving them in silence. I changed
the subject:</p>

<p>“She says she’ll never sing again. It’s very unfortunate.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Stregazzi harpooned the hat with an enormously
long pin, tipped by a diamond cluster.</p>

<p>“Never sing again&mdash;oh, rats!”</p>

<p>She grimaced as she charged with the pin through
a series of obstructions.</p>

<p>“Don’t you be afraid, dearie. She’ll sing&mdash;she
can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“But she’s positive about it. She insists.”</p>

<p>“Does she?” She shook her head, testing the
solidity of the anchorage. “She’ll be back singing
before the spring. <i>You</i> don’t know, but it’s in her
blood. We can’t keep off, none of us. And <i>she!</i>
Just wait. That’s all she’s made for.”</p>

<p>The little Stregazzi had come to an end of her
adventure against the newel post. She lolled upon
it, wiping the crevices with her fingers, then looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
at her gloves to see how much dirtier they were.</p>

<p>Her mother descended a step, paused, cogitated,
then turned to me, frowning.</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s done nothing for her?”</p>

<p>I saw she meant money. The astonishing rawness
of it made me redden to my hair. She waited for
my answer, blind apparently to the expression of
anger which must have been as plain as my outraged
blush.</p>

<p>“As to that&mdash;” I began haughtily.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t. Well, I’ll send her round fifty dollars
to-morrow and if that’s not enough drop me a line
at mother’s and I’ll forward some more. This is
the best contract I’ve ever had.”</p>

<p>When I explained and tried to thank her for Lizzie
she laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother to tell her about it. It’s all
in the day’s work. If you’ve got some rich woman
interested in her so much the better. But, dearie,”
she laid her hand on mine resting on the banister,
“don’t you fret about her. <i>She’ll</i> go back to the
old stamping ground.”</p>

<p>When I went back into the room Lizzie was sitting
in the wicker chair gazing out of the window.
She spoke without looking at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“Do you know what I feel like? As if it was night
and I was on a ship going out to sea, and as if the
land was getting smaller and smaller. I can just see
the lights of houses and little towns twinkling in a
line along the edge of the shore.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the ship going?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know and I don’t care,” came her answer
through the dusk.</p>

<p>A knock cut off my reply. It was Roger, dropped
in for an hour before dinner. Lizzie rose and was
for going, but I urged her to stay and she sank
back in her chair, glad, poor soul, to be with us
and escape the dreariness of her own thoughts.
I lit the student lamp and he and I sat down by it
with Lizzie near the window, the light falling across
her skirts, the upper part of her dimly blocked out
in shadows and the pale patches of her face and
hands.</p>

<p>As usual, she said almost nothing and a selfish
fear stirred in me that she was going to spoil our
hour. It’s hard for two people on intimate confidential
terms, to have a gay spontaneous interview
while a third sits dumb in a corner. I think Roger
felt the irk of it at first. He did most of the talking
and he did it to me. But as the time wore on I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>noticed that he began to address himself more and
more to her. He seemed unconscious of it and it set
me wondering. Was he&mdash;a man not susceptible to
personal influences&mdash;going to feel that queer magnetic
draw? It interested me so much that I forgot
to follow what he said and watched him, and there
was no doubt about it&mdash;he <i>did</i> keep turning toward
the window, where he could see nothing but a motionless
shape and the indistinct oval of a face.</p>

<p>The conversation resolved itself into a monologue,
two mute ladies and a talking man.</p>

<p>Roger really did feel it; Roger, who would hardly
listen to me when I told him about her in the restaurant.
It showed what a force she possessed,
and my fancy dwelt on it till I began to see it as
a visible thing stretching from her and reaching
out toward him. It was an uncanny idea, but it
obsessed me, and Roger’s voice sunk to a rumbling
bass murmur as I tried to picture what it might
look like&mdash;a thin steady ray like a search-light, or
a quivering thread of vibrating air, or long clutching
tentacles such as an octopus has, or a spectral
arm of gigantic size like the one Eusapia Pallidino
conjured out of shape when “the conditions were
favorable.” The cessation of his voice broke my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>imaginings and I was rather glad of it. Next time
I see him I’m going to tell him about them and ask
him which of the collection it felt most like.</p>

<p>I wrote all this a week ago, and reading it over
to-night it seems strange that I was only amused,
strange by contrast with the way I feel about the
same thing now. It’s not that there’s any difference,
or that anything has gone wrong, but&mdash;well,
it was a joke then and it doesn’t seem to be a joke
any more.</p>

<p>What’s made the change was something that happened
here this afternoon. It’s nothing at all, but
it disturbed me. I hate to think it did. I hate to
write it did. I hate to have the suspicious petty
side of me come up and look at me and say: “I’m
still here. You can’t get rid of me. I’m bound up
with the rest of you and every now and then I
break loose.”</p>

<p>If I wasn’t a foreboding simpleton who had had
her nerve shaken by bad luck I’d simply laugh.
And instead of doing that I feel like a cat on the
edge of a pond with a stone tied around its neck, and
I can’t sleep. I put out the light and went to bed
and here I am up again, wrappered and slippered,
writing it out. If I put it down in black and white,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>see it staring up at me in plain words, it will fall
back into its proper place. An insignificant thing&mdash;a
nonsensical thing&mdash;the kind of thing you tell to
your friends at a lunch as a good story on yourself.</p>

<p>I was out with Betty and didn’t get home till
five. As I came up the stairs I heard voices on the
top floor, just a low rise and fall, nothing distinguishing.
Since her illness Lizzie keeps her sitting-room
door open and I knew the voices were from
there. I supposed one of the admirers was with her
and went into my rooms and took off my things.
Then I thought it would be nice to go up and make
them tea. And I went up and it was Roger.</p>

<p>That’s all.</p>

<p>Why should <i>that</i> keep me awake? Why all evening
should it have kept coming up between me and
the pages I tried to read? Aren’t they both my
friends? Why can’t they laugh and talk together
and I be contented? And it was all so natural and
explicable. Roger had come to <i>my</i> door and, finding
me out, had gone up there to wait for me.</p>

<p>But&mdash;oh! Why should one woman be beautiful
and one plain? Why should one charm without an
effort, be lovely with a flower’s unstudied grace,
and another stand awkward, chained in a stupid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>reserve, caught in a web of self-consciousness, afraid
of being herself? Why is Lizzie Harris as she is
and I as I am? I can’t write any more, I don’t get
anywhere. I know it’s all right. I <i>know</i> it, but&mdash;something
keeps me awake.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t’s</span> two weeks to-day since that night when I
couldn’t sleep. It’s been a horrible two weeks&mdash;a
sickening, disintegrating two weeks. My existence
has been dislocated, thrown wide of its bearings,
as if the world had taken a sudden wild revolution,
whirled me through space, and I had come up dizzy
and bewildered, still in the old setting, but with
everything broken and upside down.</p>

<p>It began with that visit of Roger to Lizzie’s sitting-room.
The morning after I felt humiliated,
utterly ashamed of myself. It’s no new thing for
me to be a fool. I permit myself that luxury. But
to be a mean-spirited, suspicious fool was indulging
myself too far. I saw Lizzie and she spoke about
Roger, simply and sweetly, and my folly grew to a
monumental size, beneath which I was crushed.
And my dread faded as the horror of a nightmare
fades when the morning comes, with the sun and
the sounds of every day.</p>

<p>I have heard people say that these moments of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>relief in a period of anxiety are all that enable
one to bear the strain. I don’t think that’s true.
Alterations of stress and serenity tear one to pieces.
If you’re going to be put on the rack it’s better to
have no reprieve. Then your mind accepts it, gets
accustomed to it and you tune up your nerves, screw
your courage to the sticking place and march forward
with the calm of the hopeless.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon&mdash;that was yesterday&mdash;Roger
and I were to have tea with Mrs. Ashworth.
He came earlier than I expected, wanting to take
a walk with me before we went there. Lizzie was
in my sitting-room, also Miss Bliss, picking over
the last box of chocolates contributed by the count.
Miss Bliss was not dressed for receiving&mdash;instead of
the kimono and the safety pin she wore the Navajo
blanket, and when she saw him she gave a cry that
would have done credit to Susanna when she discovered
the elders. I would have seen the humor of
it&mdash;the model who had posed for the altogether in
abject confusion at being caught huddled to the chin
in a blanket as thick as a carpet&mdash;had I not had all
humor stricken from me by the sight of Roger in the
doorway. The cry had halted him. He evidently
had no idea what had caused it. His eyes swerved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>from Miss Bliss to sweep the room in a quick questioning
glance. When it touched Lizzie something
shot up in it&mdash;the question was answered. Miss Bliss
made her escape without anybody noticing her, and
I heard about the walk and went into the back room
to get my outdoor things.</p>

<p>I have explained how the kitchenette and bathroom
are a connecting passage between the two
larger rooms of the suite. I came back through
them, and having left the sitting-room door open,
could see at the end of the little vista Roger and
Lizzie by the table. As once before I had stopped
to watch them, I stopped now, not smilingly this
time, but furtively, guiltily.</p>

<p>They were talking together. To watch wasn’t
enough&mdash;I had to hear and I stole forward, stepping
lightly over the bathroom rug and half closed
the door. Standing against it, I listened. Heaven
knows the conversation was innocent enough. She
was telling him about a bracelet she wore that belonged
to some of those Spanish people she was descended
from. I suddenly felt as if I was looking
through a keyhole, and had stretched out my hand
to shut the door when a silence fell. Then all the
acquired decencies of race and breeding left me. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>pushed the door open a crack and peered in. She
had taken the bracelet off and given it to him and
he was turning it about, studying it while she
watched him.</p>

<p>“I’ve been told it’s quite valuable as an antique,”
she said. “Do you suppose it really is?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the antique, but I should
think it might have some value. The design’s very
unusual,” he answered, and handed it back to her.</p>

<p>She clasped it on her arm, and as she did so, her
head down-bent, they were silent, his eyes on her
face.</p>

<p>I had never seen him look at any woman that way,
but I had seen other men. It is an unmistakable look,
the mute confession of that passion which makes the
proudest man a slave.</p>

<p>I closed the door and leaned against it. For a
moment I felt sick and frightened&mdash;frightened at
what I’d seen and frightened of myself.</p>

<p>Presently I came into the room and found them
still talking of the bracelet. And then Roger and I
started for our walk, leaving Lizzie alone.</p>

<p>He suggested that we go round the reservoir and
I agreed, stepping along silently beside him. It was
a raw bleak afternoon, no sun, everything gray. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>streets were sprinkled with sauntering Sunday people
who had a detached dark aspect against the toneless
monochrome. They looked as if they were moving
in front of painted scenery. The park was wintry,
sear boughs patterned against the sky, blurs of
denuded bushes, expanses of hoary grass. Along the
roadway the ruts were growing crumbly with the
frost, and little spears and splinters of ice edged
the puddles.</p>

<p>The reservoir shone a smooth steely lake, with
broken groups of figures moving about it. Some of
them walked briskly, others loitered, red and chilled.
All kinds of people were making the circuit of that
body of confined and conquered water&mdash;Jews and
Gentiles, simple and gentle, couples of lovers, companies
of young men, family parties with the children
getting in the way and being shoved to one side,
stiff stout women like Betty trying to lose a few
pounds. On the west side vast apartment-houses
made a rampart, pierced with windows like a line
of forts.</p>

<p>We commented on the cold and Roger quickened
the pace, sweeping me along the path’s outer edge.
Presently he began to talk of Lizzie, leaning down
to catch my answers, keen, impatient, straining to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>hear me and not lose a word. He is a tall man and
I am a small woman and I bobbed along at his shoulder
trying to keep up with him, trying to sound
bright and interested, and feeling myself a meager
unlovely body carrying a sick and shriveled heart.</p>

<p>“No, she’ll never sing again,” I said, in answer to
a question. “She seems to have made up her mind
to that.”</p>

<p>He swung his cane, cutting at the head of a dry
weed.</p>

<p>“That’s a good thing.”</p>

<p>“Why is it a good thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, because,” he dropped a pace behind me to
let a straggling, red-nosed family pass and I craned
my head back to hear him. “She’s not fitted for that
kind of life. It’s not for women like her.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>He was beside me again.</p>

<p>“She’s too&mdash;er&mdash;too fine, too delicately organized.”</p>

<p>I didn’t answer. Knowing what I did, what was
there for me to say?</p>

<p>“The women to succeed in that have got to be aggressive,
fight their way like men. She never could
do it.”</p>

<p>I again had no response and we fared on, I trying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>to keep up, hungry for his next word and fearful
of what it might be. It came in a voice that had an
artificial note of carelessness.</p>

<p>“What’s become of that man you told me about,
that man we saw in the hall one night when you first
went up there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s become of him.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen him lately?”</p>

<p>“No, not for some weeks.”</p>

<p>There was another pause. I wasn’t going to help
him. It was part of my torment to wait and see how
he was going to get the information he wanted, to
see Roger, uneasy and jealous, feeling round a subject,
not daring to be frank. When he could wait
no longer his voice showed a leashed and guarded
impatience.</p>

<p>“You led me to believe he was a great friend of
hers.”</p>

<p>“He <i>was</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>Was?</i> Is he so no longer?”</p>

<p>“No, they’ve had a quarrel of some sort.”</p>

<p>“Umph.”</p>

<p>Again a silence. We passed a trio of Jewish girls
in long coats who looked me over solemnly with
large languorous eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“He was a horrible-looking bounder,” he said.</p>

<p>“He was what he looked,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Then how,” he exclaimed, unable to restrain the
question, “<i>could</i> he have been a friend of hers?”</p>

<p>He was embarrassed and ashamed, and to hide it
cut vigorously at the dead weeds with his cane.
Through this childish ruse his desire to know was as
plain as if he had expressed it in words of one
syllable.</p>

<p>“He was her sponsor. She was a sort of speculation
of his; he was training her for the operatic
stage. I’ve told you all this before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but&mdash;well, it’s a reasonable explanation.”</p>

<p>He had been speaking with his face turned from
me, his eyes following the slashings of the cane. Now
he lifted his head and looked across to the apartment-houses.
The movement, the brightened expression,
the tone of his voice, told of a lifted weight.
He had heard it all before, but then he hadn’t cared.
Now, caring, he wanted to hear it again, to be assured,
to have all uncertainty appeased.</p>

<p>“It was a business arrangement,” he said. “Yes,
I remember, you told me some time ago.”</p>

<p>This time I didn’t answer because a thought had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>surged up in my mind that had put everything else
out&mdash;I ought to tell him! He was under Lizzie’s
spell and Lizzie was as unknown to him as if she
had been an inhabitant of Mars. He was charmed
by a creature of his own creating, an ideal built up
on her beauty and her weakness. Did he know her
as she really was he would have recoiled from her
as if she had been one of the sirens from whom
Ulysses fled. She was the opposite of everything
he imagined her to be, of everything he held sacred
in woman. John Masters had been her lover. It
was appalling, monstrous. I <i>must</i> tell him.</p>

<p>And then I thought of her and how she had confessed
her secret and I had said I wouldn’t tell.</p>

<p>The impulse to reveal it for his sake and the impulse
to keep silent for hers, began to struggle in
me. I became a battle-ground of two contending
forces. The desire to tell was strongest; it was like
a live thing fighting to get out. It filled me, crushed
every other thought and impulse, swelled up through
my throat and pressed on my lips. I bit them and
walked on with fixed eyes. As if from a distance I
heard Roger’s voice:</p>

<p>“From what you said he must be an impossible
cad. I knew she couldn’t have had him for a friend.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>Poor girl, having to associate with a man like that because
business demanded it. What a rotten existence.”</p>

<p>I had to tell.</p>

<p>“Roger,” I said, hearing my voice sound hoarse.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I felt suddenly dizzy and halted. Like a vision
I saw Lizzie lying on the sofa, whispering to me
that Masters had left her. The inside of my mouth
was so dry I had difficulty in articulating. I stammered:</p>

<p>“Wait. I can’t walk so fast.”</p>

<p>He was very apologetic.</p>

<p>“Oh, Evie, dear, I beg your pardon. You should
have told me before. I am so used to walking alone
that I forgot.”</p>

<p>We moved at a slower pace. The view that had
receded from my vision came back. My face was
damp and the icy air blowing on it was good. The
spiritual fight went on, with my heart beating and
beating like a terrible warlike drum urging me on.
Now was the time for him to know, before it was
too late. We were half-way round&mdash;I could get it
over before we’d made the full circuit. And then
I’d be at peace, would have done a hideous thing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>that I ought to do. Now&mdash;now! I fetched up a
breath from the bottom of my lungs. He spoke:</p>

<p>“That’s why she oughtn’t to go on with this singing.
It brings a woman into contact with people
that she shouldn’t meet.”</p>

<p>Each sentence seemed to point my way clearer.
If he’d had any doubts, hadn’t been so completely
without suspicion. But to hear him talk this way!
I tried to make a beginning with Lizzie’s whispering
voice getting in the way. I couldn’t find a
phrase, nothing came but blunt brutal words. There
was a moment when I thought I was going to cry
these out, scream at him, “Roger, she was that man’s
mistress!” Then everything blurred and I caught
hold of the fence.</p>

<p>I was pulled back to reality by the quick concern
of his voice.</p>

<p>“Evie, are you ill?”</p>

<p>I suppose I looked awful. His face told me so; he
was evidently scared. I realized I couldn’t go on
with it, must wait till a better time. The thought
quieted me and my voice was almost natural, though
my lips felt loose and shaky.</p>

<p>“I’m tired, I think.”</p>

<p>“You’re as white as death. Why didn’t you tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>me? Good heavens, what an idiot I am not to have
noticed before.”</p>

<p>Two men and a child stopped. The intent and
glassy interest of their eyes helped to pull me together.
I let go of the fence and put my hands,
trembling as if with an ague, into my muff. Roger
gave the trio a savage look, before which they
quailed and slunk reluctantly away, watching us
over their shoulders.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said commandingly, and pulled my
hand through his arm. “We’ll go to the Eighty-sixth
Street entrance and get a cab.”</p>

<p>We walked forward, arm in arm, and I gradually
revived. I couldn’t come to any decision now. I
wasn’t fit. I must think it over by myself. My
forces began to come back and the feeling of my
insides falling down into my shoes went away. Roger
was in a state of deep contrition and concern, bending
down to look into my face, while I held close
to his arm. People stared at us. I think they took us
for lovers. They must have thought the gentleman
had singular taste to be in love with such a sorry
specimen of a woman.</p>

<p>When we reached the Eighty-sixth Street entrance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>he wanted to take me home, but I insisted on going
to Mrs. Ashworth’s. I couldn’t bear the thought of
my own rooms. Alone there, I would go back to
that appalling subject and I couldn’t stand any more
of it now. We got into a taxi and sped away through
the Sunday quietness of the city, sweeping through
Columbus Circle and then down to Fifth Avenue. I
leaned against the window watching the long line
of vehicles. I was empty of sensation, gutted like a
burned-out house, and that purposeful procession
caught and carried my attention, exercising on my
spent being a hypnotic attraction. Roger, finding me
inclined for silence, sat back in his corner and
lighted a cigarette. He had accepted my explanations
in perturbed good faith. We sped on this way,
with the glittering rush that swept by my window,
lulling me into a sort of exhausted torpor.</p>

<p>The usual adjusting of myself to Mrs. Ashworth’s
environment was not necessary. I harmonized better
than I had ever done before. I am sure every
red corpuscle in my blood was pale, and if, on my
former visits I had instinctively moved softly, now
I did so because I was too limp to move any other
way. If refinement, as some people think, is merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>an evidence of depleted vitality, I ought to have appeared
one of the most refined females of my day
and generation.</p>

<p>Betty was there and Harry Ferguson, Harry
obviously ill at ease. I know just how he felt&mdash;as if
he was too big for the chairs, and when he spoke it
sounded like a stevedore. I used to feel that my
manner of speech oscillated between that of the cowgirl
in a western melodrama and the heroine of one
of my favorite G. P. R. James’ romances, who, when
she went out riding, described herself as “ascending
her palfrey.” Betty, I noticed, escaped the general
blight. She is too nervelessly unconscious; wouldn’t
be bothered trying to correspond with anybody’s
environment.</p>

<p>I sat in a Sheraton chair and watched Mrs. Ashworth’s
hands as she made tea. The prominent veins
interested me. I have heard that they are an indication
of blue blood, and though they are not pretty,
they suit Mrs. Ashworth as everything about her
does. Her hands move deftly and without hurry
and she never interrupts conversation with queries
about sugar and cream. A maid, who was neither
young nor old, pretty nor ugly, an unobtrusive,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>perfectly articulated piece of household machinery,
made noiseless flittings with plates. Mrs. Ashworth
does not like men servants. I suppose they are
clumsy and by their large bulky shapes and gruff
voices, disturb the rhythm of that beautiful, mellow,
subdued room.</p>

<p>Presently I was sipping my tea and looking at
Harry Ferguson trying to sip his in a perfect way.
I knew that he didn’t like tea, would have preferred
a Scotch highball, but didn’t dare to ask for it. He
spilled some on the saucer, then dropped the spoon
and had to grovel for it, coming up red and guilty,
looking as if he had been caught in some shameful
act. I could hear him telling Betty on the way home
that it was nonsense taking him to tea&mdash;why the
devil hadn’t she dropped him at the club. And
Betty, making vague consoling sounds while she
studied the appointments of passing motors.</p>

<p>Then suddenly they began to talk of Lizzie Harris
and I forgot Mrs. Ashworth’s veins and Harry’s
embarrassments. Betty explained her to our hostess,
and I sat looking into my cup and listening. It was
what might have been called the popularized version
of a complicated subject&mdash;Lizzie as a sad and chastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
neophyte who had failed in a great undertaking
and been shattered. Mrs. Ashworth was
softly sympathetic. She turned to me.</p>

<p>“Roger tells me that she is a charming person
and very handsome.”</p>

<p>I agreed.</p>

<p>“Pretty tough,” Harry growled. Then abashed
by the rudeness of his tone, cleared his throat and
stared at Roger Clements the Signer as if he had
never noticed him before.</p>

<p>“I was wondering,” said Betty, “if she could
teach singing. You know she has nothing.”</p>

<p>I became aware that Betty had not come for
nothing to sit on a Sheraton chair and drink tea.
As usual she had “a basic idea”. So had Mrs.
Ashworth&mdash;two entirely dissimilar minds had converged
to the same point.</p>

<p>“Roger and I were talking about her the other
evening,” said Roger’s sister, “and I suggested that
there are a great many women teachers and their
standing is good, I hear.”</p>

<p>On the subject of the wage-earning woman Mrs.
Ashworth is not well informed. I fancy she has
admitted the fact that there must be wage-earning
women with reluctance. It would be better for them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>all to be in homes with worthy husbands. But it
has penetrated even to Mrs. Ashworth’s sheltered
corner that these adjuncts are not always found.</p>

<p>“We could get her pupils,” said Betty with determination&mdash;she
felt Mrs. Ashworth’s quality sufficiently
to subdue it&mdash;“pupils among the right sort
of people. And you and I, and some others I know,
could give her a proper start.”</p>

<p>They talked on outlining a career for Lizzie as
a singing teacher of the idle rich. They would put
her on her feet, they would make her more than
self-supporting. Their combined social influence
extended over that narrow belt which passes up
through Manhattan Island like a vein of gold. Lizzie
would be placed in a position to tap the vein.</p>

<p>If I had suddenly hurled the truth into that benevolent
conspiracy, what a transformation! All the
interest now centered round that pitiful figure would
dissolve like a morning mist and float away to collect
about something more deserving and understandable.
If I should represent her case as sufficiently
desperate they would give her money, but
that much more valuable thing they were giving
now&mdash;the hand extended in fellowship&mdash;would be
withdrawn as from the contact of a leper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>In <i>their</i> case I felt no obligation to tell. What
they were doing would not hurt them and it was
necessary for her. I came back to the old starting
point&mdash;to help her, to get her back to where she
ought to be, I must deceive and go on deceiving.
Unquestionably something was wrong with my
world. If I could only have lived in Pippa’s or
fitted Pippa’s philosophy to mine! But could anybody?
I wish Robert Browning was in my place,
sitting here to-night by the student lamp, half dead
trying to decide what is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Oh, I’m so tired&mdash;and I can’t get away from it, I
can’t stop thinking of it. Why did they ever meet?
Why did I go down-stairs that afternoon and bring
him up? Why did a man&mdash;cold and indifferent&mdash;suddenly
catch fire as he had done? Why couldn’t
I be left in peace? Why was it he, my man, who
had come to bring me back to life and joy? Why?
why? why?</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hings</span> have been in a state of quiescence for
the last few days and then, yesterday, there
was a new development.</p>

<p>When I say things have been quiescent, I mean
on the outside. In the inside I have been as far
from quiescent as I ever was in my life. That last
year with Harmon wasn’t nearly so bad as this. It
was just my own affair then. When your heart is
breaking you can sit quiet and listen to it cracking
and it doesn’t matter to anybody but yourself. It’s
just a chance of fate that you should be a little floating
particle full of pain. The world goes on the
same and you don’t matter.</p>

<p>But when other people’s destinies are tangled up
in yours, when you have to decide what’s best for
<i>them</i> with your reason and your inclination pulling
different ways&mdash;that’s having trouble for your
shadow in the daytime and your bedfellow at night.
If I was an indifferent spectator who could stand
off and study the situation with an impartial eye, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>could come to a just decision. It’s trying to lift
myself out of it and be fair that’s so agonizing&mdash;it’s
being afraid that I may tell for my own sake, betray
Lizzie to save myself.</p>

<p>There are strong, clear-minded people who could
think straight to a conclusion, take the responsibility
and act, then eat their dinner and go peacefully
to bed. I’m not one of them. I’ve always
been the kind who sees both sides and wavers, afraid
if they champion one they may be unjust to the
other. Last night I was thinking of the girl in
<i>The Master Builder</i> when she tells the hero that
he hasn’t “a robust conscience.” Then I thought
of John Masters and how he broke the fetters of
his own forging. They were both right. I can see
it and I admit it but I never would have had the
courage to do as they did. To hurt and hurt for
yourself&mdash;no, I couldn’t.&mdash;But I must get on to the
new development.</p>

<p>Betty came yesterday afternoon and took me for
a drive. Under normal circumstances this is one
of my greatest treats. To be with Betty is always
good, and to watch the glory of New York on
parade while Betty explains charitable schemes or
gives advice on the best mode of life for a widow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>of moderate means, has been one of the joys of the
winter. Then there were small individual pleasures
that I silently savored as we glided along: the
springy softness of the cushions, the fine feel of the
fur rug, wonderful clothes in show-windows, and
wonderful clothes out of show-windows making
beautiful ladies more beautiful. And there was an
experience that never lost its zest, full of a thrilling
significance: when we all stopped, a block of vehicles
from curb to curb, and let the foot passengers
pass. It assured me we were still a democracy. If
we had lived in the days before the French Revolution
we’d have gone dashing along and the foot
passengers would have had to dodge our proud
wheels at the peril of their lives. Now we wait on
their convenience. I have seen the whole traffic
drawn up while a tramp shuffled across, while we
millionaires&mdash;I am always a millionaire when I
ride with Betty&mdash;sat back and were patient. I have
always hoped Thomas Jefferson was somewhere
where he could look down and see.</p>

<p>Yesterday all joy and interest were gone from it.
Odd how our inward vision gives the color to externals;
how, when our spirit is darkened, the sun
gets dim and the sky less blue. We paint the world
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>ourselves. I remember after my mother died that
for a long time all nature looked gray and my close
cozy intimacy with it was suddenly gone. But, that’s
another story.</p>

<p>Betty lifted me out of a depressed silence by a
suggestion; she said it had been germinating in her
mind since Sunday. Wouldn’t it be better, instead
of starting her as teacher, to send Lizzie Harris to
Europe for several years to go on with her studies?</p>

<p>“She oughtn’t to give up all she’s done, and teaching
singing when you’ve expected to be a prima
donna yourself, isn’t a very exhilarating prospect.”</p>

<p>It was so like Betty! Always thinking of something
just a little bit better. Mrs. Ashworth never
would have got beyond the teaching and it had taken
Roger and Betty to get her that far. I straightened
up and felt that the afternoon was brightening.</p>

<p>“It’s too early for her to throw it up,” Betty went
on. “She hasn’t given it a fair trial. She gets one
setback and an illness and then says it’s over. I
don’t believe it is and I want to give her another
chance.”</p>

<p>“But”&mdash;to keep square with myself I had to bring
up difficulties&mdash;“she declares she’ll never sing
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, rubbish! We all declare we’ll never do
things again. Harry and I had a fight last autumn
and <i>I</i> declared I’d never speak to him again, and I
was speaking&mdash;and glad to do it&mdash;in two hours.”</p>

<p>“Your husband’s not your profession.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” said Betty with a smile, “but my
marriage is, and being a successful wife is not so
very different from being a successful prima donna.
I tell you this is all nonsense about her refusing to
go on. She’s cut out for the stage. The opera
bores me to death. I’d never go if it wasn’t for my
two strings of pearls and the prohibitive price of the
box. But I really think, if she was in it, I could
stand even <i>Tristan and Isolde</i>.”</p>

<p>I looked out of the window&mdash;wonderful how the
gay animation of the street had come back. And
it was Betty’s idea and Betty was generally right.</p>

<p>“I could suggest it to her,” I said.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I intend you to do, and as
soon as possible. I hate things dangling on. Make
it perfectly plain to her: I’ll undertake the whole
matter, give her as long a time as she needs with
any teacher she chooses. And don’t you see if she’s
taken out of this place where she’s had the failure
and been so discouraged, she’ll take a fresh hold?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>It’ll be a new start in new surroundings, and she’ll
feel like a new person.”</p>

<p>The most sensitively self-questioning woman must
have admitted the force of the argument. If Betty’s
previous efforts to play the god in the machine had
been ill-inspired, this time she redeemed herself.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said cheerfully. “As Mrs. Stregazzi
would say, I’ll ‘take it up with her’ this
evening.”</p>

<p>Betty took me home and I ran up the stairs. I
was like a child hastening to impart joyful tidings.
Lizzie was in her kitchen occupied over household
affairs. A glass lamp turned too high, stood on a
shelf, the delicate skein of smoke rising from its
chimney, painting a dusky circle on the ceiling. The
gas, also too high, rushed from its burner in a torn
flame that leaped and hissed like a live thing caught
and in pain. Lizzie, being well enough to attend to
her own needs, the place was once more in chaos. I
turned down the lamp and the gas, shut off the sink
faucet, which was noisily dribbling, and lifting a
pie from the one wooden chair, put it on the ice-box
and sat down to impart my news.</p>

<p>She listened without interruption, leaning against
the wash-tub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” I said, as she didn’t speak. My voice
was sharp, her silence got on my nerves.</p>

<p>“To go to Europe and study,” she said dreamily,
“that’s been the dream of my life.”</p>

<p>“Well, your dream’s come true, Lizzie!” I jumped
up ready to take her in my arms and hug her. “You
can go as soon as your trunk’s packed.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“It’s too late now.”</p>

<p>“Too late!” I fell back from her, unbelieving,
aghast&mdash;“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Her face bore an expression of sad renouncement.</p>

<p>“The dream’s over, I’m awake.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’re going to refuse.”</p>

<p>She gravely nodded.</p>

<p>“But, Lizzie, think, listen. You don’t realize what
a chance this is. Any teacher you may choose,
for as long as you like, all worry about money over.
I know Mrs. Ferguson, she’s never attempted anything
that she hasn’t carried through&mdash;”</p>

<p>I launched forth into a eulogy of Betty, and
branched from that into a list of the advantages accruing
to the object of her bounty, holding them up,
viewing them from all sides like choice articles I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>was offering for sale. I was eloquent, I was persuasive,
I introduced irrefutable arguments. Any
other woman standing with reluctant feet on the
verge of such an enterprise, would have ceased to
be reluctant and leaped toward the future I pictured.</p>

<p>But Lizzie was immovable. I saw my words flying
off her as if they were bird-shot striking on an
armored cruiser. She had only one reason for refusing
but that was beyond the power of words to
shake&mdash;she had given up her career as a singer;
nothing would ever make her return to it.</p>

<p>I sank down on the wooden chair, my head on my
breast, despair claiming me. She went about the
kitchen in a vague incompetent way picking things
up and putting them down, then suddenly wanting
them and forgetting where they were. As she trailed
about she drove home her refusal with a series of
disconnected sentences, bubbles of thought rising
to occasional speech. I didn’t answer her, sitting
crumpled on the chair&mdash;until she had refused, I
hadn’t realized how much I had hoped.</p>

<p>Presently she swept into the back room, carrying
a pile of plates with the air of an empress bearing
the royal insignia. I heard her setting them on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>the dining-table and then a rattle of silver. She
came back and hunted about, feeling on shelves and
opening cupboard doors, then said, in the deep tones
made for the great tragic rôles:</p>

<p>“Evie, there was a lemon pie somewhere around
here. You’re not sitting on it by any chance?”</p>

<p>Filled with misery I indicated the pie on the top
of the ice-box. In the pursuit of her domestic duties
she had thrown a dish-cloth over it. She removed
the cloth, and picking up the pie, looked it over
solicitously.</p>

<p>“You’re going to sup with me to-night and eat
this.”</p>

<p>The bitter appropriativeness of Lizzie feeding me
on lemon pie pierced through my anguish&mdash;I
laughed. I laughed with a loud strident note, leaning
my head back against the wall and looking at
the smoke mark on the ceiling. Lizzie, pie in hand,
stood looking at me in majestic surprise.</p>

<p>“What are you laughing at?”</p>

<p>“My thoughts. They’re very funny&mdash;you and I,
sitting up here alone and carousing on lemon pie.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to be alone. Mr. Clements is
coming. I asked him to supper and when he looked
uncertain tempted him by saying you’d be here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>Roger and I eating lemon pie, dispensed by
Lizzie&mdash;now the gods were laughing, too.</p>

<p>“I can’t come,” I said sulkily.</p>

<p>She looked utterly dismayed, as if she had heard
a piece of news too direful to believe. If it had been
any one but Lizzie Harris I should have said she
was going to cry.</p>

<p>“Not come! Why not?”</p>

<p>“Mightn’t I have an engagement?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t. I asked you if you had this
morning.”</p>

<p>“I have a headache.”</p>

<p>She put the pie on the wash-tub with a distracted
gesture, and began beseechingly, her head tilted toward
her shoulder, eyes and mouth pleading:</p>

<p>“Ah, now, Evie, <i>don’t</i> have a headache. The party
was to be a surprise for you. I’ve been getting it
together all afternoon. And I ordered the pie
especially. <i>Please</i> feel well. Mr. Clements has been
so good to me and I wanted to return his kindness
and I knew he wouldn’t enjoy it half so much if
you weren’t here.”</p>

<p>I know every word was genuine. I believe she
is still ignorant of Roger’s feeling for her. One
of the things I have often noticed about her is that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>she seems unconscious of, or indifferent to, her attraction
for men. I have never heard her speak of
it or seen her show any pleasure in it. Small coquettes
and flirts, the women who make a study of
charming, can not hide their pride of conquest, love
to recount the havoc they have wrought. There is
none of that in Lizzie. Sometimes I have thought
she is so used to admiration that she accepts it as a
part of her life, like the sunshine or the rain.
Roger, as “a kind man,” is just lumped in with
the count and the doctor and Mr. Hamilton. And
with her blindness to other people’s claims she
makes no inquiry, takes no notice of the humbler
romances of the rest of us. She has never said a
word to me about Roger as <i>my</i> friend. If she has
ever given it a thought she has ticketed him as just
“a kind man” to me also.</p>

<p>I lay back in the wooden chair and stared at her
with a haggard glance.</p>

<p>“Do you like Mr. Clements, Lizzie,” I said solemnly.</p>

<p>She nodded, then reached for the pie and began
touching its surface with the tip of a finger.</p>

<p>“Immensely. I don’t see how any one could help
it. He’s so kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>Her attention was concentrated on what she held.
She scrutinized it as if it were a treasure in which
she searched for a possible flaw.</p>

<p>“He’s more than kind,” I answered. Even in my
misery I felt a tinge of irritation that she should
accept Roger’s homage as if he was of no more
value than the count or the doctor.</p>

<p>“Of course he is,” she replied. “He’s so intellectual.
And then he has such lovely manners.
I think he’s more of a gentleman than any man I’ve
ever known.”</p>

<p>I thought of Masters. Was she in her mind comparing
them? If she was there was no sign of it
in her face. She murmured a commendatory phrase
of the pie, and holding it off on the palm of an outspread
hand, carried it into the back room.</p>

<p>I sat on the wooden chair staring after her. Did
she care for Roger? Was she going to transfer her
incomprehensible affections to him? It was a hideous
thought. She came back and swept about, collecting
the feast, and my dazed eyes followed her. How
could she do such a thing unless she was so lacking
in a central core of character that she was nothing
but the shell of a woman?</p>

<p>It was a queer scrappy meal, most of it sent round
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>from the delicatessen store on Lexington Avenue.
Such as it was the hostess offered it with as smiling
an aplomb as if Delmonico’s head chef had produced
it in an inspired moment. No qualm that her chief
guest might not enjoy ham and beer disturbed her
gracious serenity. Petronius Arbiter treating his
emperor to a gastronomic orgy, could not have recommended
the nightingale’s tongues more confidently
than Lizzie did the canned asparagus, bought at
a discount.</p>

<p>That Roger enjoyed it was evident. I don’t suppose
he had ever been at a supper where the ladies
waited and sometimes, when the plates ran short,
washed them between courses. Lizzie’s inexpertness
caused continuous breaks in the progress of the feast&mdash;important
items overlooked, consultations as to the
proper order of the viands, an unexpected shortage
of small silver. Before we had got to the canned
asparagus, I found myself assuming the management.
Roger rising and pursuing an aimless search
for the beer opener, and Lizzie making rapid futile
gropings for it in the backs of drawers and the bottoms
of bowls, was distracting to my orderly sense.
They couldn’t find it anywhere. They had too
much to say, got in each other’s way, forgot to hunt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>and stood laughing, while I took up the search and
ran it to earth on a nail in the kitchen.</p>

<p>After that the party shifted its base entirely and
became mine. They were glad to relinquish it to
me, took their seats with the air of those who know
an uncongenial task has found the proper hands. I
directed it, grimly attentive, and it was not the least
of my pain that I saw they thought I was pleased to
do so. If I had ever done any one a deadly wrong
he would have been avenged had he seen me&mdash;making
things pleasant for Roger and Lizzie, ministering
to their creature comfort, too engrossed
in my labors to join in. I was the chaperon, I was
the maiden aunt, I was Mrs. Grundy.</p>

<p>When we reached the last course I found that the
coffee machine had not been emptied of the morning’s
dregs and took it into the kitchen, while Lizzie
put the pie on the table. From my place at the sink
I could see it, a foamy surface of beaten-egg, glistening
against the white expanse of cloth. Lizzie
was proud of her pie and refused my offer to cut
it. She held the knife poised for a deliberating
moment, then sliced carefully, while Roger watched
from across the table and I from beside the sink.
She cut a piece for me and put it at my place, then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>one for Roger. Leaning from her seat she handed
him the plate and he took it, the circle of porcelain
joining their hands. Over it he looked at her with
shining passion-lit eyes.</p>

<p>To me, watching from that squalid kitchen, their
outstretched arms were symbolic of their attitude
one to the other, the piece of pie, a love potion she
was offering. It was “Isolde” holding out the cup to
“Tristan”. Probably any one reading this will
laugh. Believe me, in that moment, I tasted the fulness
of despair&mdash;that darkening of the dear bright
world, that concentrating of all the pain one can feel
into one consummate pang.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVI">XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> am</span> convinced now. Roger loves her. Until
that supper I had ups and downs&mdash;times when
I felt unsure, hours when I argued myself into the
belief that I was mistaken. But when I came down
to my rooms that night my uncertainties were ended.
As I lay in the dark I saw everything as clear as
crystal. It seemed as if I was clairvoyant, caught
up above myself, the whole situation visualized before
me like a picture.</p>

<p>Since then there’s been only one question&mdash;what
ought I to do?</p>

<p>Apart from my own feeling for Roger&mdash;supposing
he was only the friend he used to be&mdash;should
I let him give his heart and his name to a woman,
whom, if he knew the truth, he would put away from
him like a leper? Every ideal and instinct that
make up the sum of his being would revolt, if he
knew about Lizzie and John Masters. I know this,
I don’t just think it because I want to. According
to his code all women must be chaste and all men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>honest, and if they’re not, he doesn’t want to have
anything to do with them. It may not be generous,
but that’s not to the point. He is so made and so will
remain. He has been kinder to me than any one in
the world&mdash;kind and just, as far as he knew. Should
I, who could prevent it, stand by and watch him&mdash;the
illustration isn’t flattering but it’s apt&mdash;rushing
toward the precipice like the Gadarene swine?</p>

<p>And then Lizzie is entirely unfitted to be the wife
of such a man. She belongs to another world that
he doesn’t understand and couldn’t tolerate. He
would think the people she foregathers with were
savages. He hasn’t seen her with them, he doesn’t
know how blind she is to the niceties of manners
and breeding that to him are essentials. I try to
fit her into his environment, put her up in a niche
beside Mrs. Ashworth&mdash;Lizzie, with her tempests,
her careless insults, her impossible friends! Suppose
there had never been any John Masters, that
she was as pure as Diana, could she ever be tamed
to the Clements’ standard?</p>

<p>Memories of her keep coming up, throwing
oranges out of the window, listening hungrily to
Mrs. Stregazzi (fancy Mrs. Stregazzi at Mrs. Ashworth’s
tea table talking about her corsets and her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>cigarettes!) facing Masters like an enraged lioness,
weeping against his shoulder and pleading with him
to come back. Good heavens, if no man had even
touched her hand except in the clasp of friendship,
she is not the woman for Roger. And she lived,
willingly, proudly, without a twinge of conscience,
with John Masters!</p>

<p>That’s one side and here’s the other:</p>

<p>Lizzie’s happiness, Lizzie placed beyond all need,
Lizzie the wife of a man so high-thinking and right-doing
that everything in her that was fine must
answer to his call. Under his influence she might
change, become what he now imagines her to be.
Women have done that often, grown to love the
man they marry and molded themselves to his
ideal. Have I the right to stand between her and
such a future, bar the way to Eden, an angel with
a flaming sword?</p>

<p>I can’t.</p>

<p>In utter abandon she told me the story that I can
now use against her. She trusted me and I answered
her trust with a promise that I would never tell,
unless she asked me to. It is true that she said she
didn’t care if I did tell. But does it matter what she
said? Wouldn’t I, if I used the permission given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>in sickness of heart and body, be meaner than the
meanest thing that crawls? Am I to buy my happiness
at such a price?</p>

<p>I can’t.</p>

<p>If she still had her career it would be different.
I could see her going forward in it, certain it was
the best thing for her. But her career is over. She
is to settle down as a singing teacher, plod on patiently,
watch others making for the goal that was
once to be hers. She can’t do it any more than she
can fly.</p>

<p>If I thought that she was vicious, bad at heart,
I would be certain I ought to tell. But with all her
faults she is generous, kindly and honest. It’s her
chance&mdash;the one chance that comes to all of us. Is
it my business to take it from her, to interfere, with
my flaming sword, and say, “No, this is not for you.
You have committed the woman’s unpardonable sin.
If you don’t feel the proper remorse it will be my
place to punish you, to shut you out from the possibilities
of redemption. Whatever <i>you</i> may think
about it, <i>I</i> think that you belong in the corral with
the goats and I’m going to do all in my power to
keep you there”?</p>

<p>I can’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>And so I go on, round and round like a squirrel
in a cage. I wonder if the squirrel ever feels as
I do.</p>

<p>They come in to see me and say I look ill. Roger
is particularly solicitous, wants me to go south for
a month with Mrs. Ashworth. I could no more
leave this place, and the spectacle of his infatuation,
than I could tell him what is making me hollow-eyed
and wan.</p>

<p>One of the bitterest of my thoughts is that I know&mdash;an
instinct tells me&mdash;he is really still fondest of
me. I am and always will be the better woman for
him, the one that in the storm and stress of a life’s
companionship, is his true mate. His feeling for
Lizzie is a temporary aberration. He has been bewitched&mdash;La
Belle Dame Sans Merci has him in
thrall. Some day he will wake from the dream&mdash;and
then? He will find Lizzie beside him, La
Belle Dame Sans Merci directing the domestic
régime, tactfully accommodating herself to his
moods, taking the place of the undistinguished wife
of a distinguished husband.</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;why do I write like this! It’s low, contemptible,
vile. I’m going to stop. I’m going to
bow my head and say it’s done and give up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>I wrote that two days ago, pressed the blotter
over it and said to myself, “The squirrel has had
enough. It’s going to lie down in its cage.”</p>

<p>To-night&mdash;it’s past midnight and a big moon is
shining on the back walls&mdash;I begin with a new pen
on a fresh sheet to show how the squirrel didn’t
stop. Poor ridiculous, demented squirrel!</p>

<p>There is a sort of grotesque humor about it, I
can stand off and laugh at myself.</p>

<p>This afternoon the count came in to see me with
news. His people have sent for him to go back to
Rome.</p>

<p>“Have you already learned the banking business
as conducted in America?” I inquired. I’m not so
sympathetic as I used to be but the count doesn’t
seem to notice it.</p>

<p>He took a cigarette and answered with deliberation:</p>

<p>“I have now, for four months, pasted letters in
a book. It seems that I am to go on forever pasting
letters in a book. I wrote it to my father and he
sends me an answer saying, ‘My son, you can paste
letters in a book as well in Rome as in New York.
Come back at once. I find this pasting too expensive!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>I expressed fitting regrets at this paternal interference.</p>

<p>“It is with great sorrow that I leave,” said the
count sadly, “I have made many charming friends
here.”</p>

<p>He removed his cigarette and bowed to me. I
inclined my head. Our mutual lack of spirits did
not prevent us from being extremely polite.</p>

<p>“You, dear madame, have been sweetly kind to
the exile. I don’t know what I should have done
without your ever beautiful sympathy.”</p>

<p>I made deprecating murmurs.</p>

<p>“A young man like myself, a romantic, must have
a confidante, one who feels and understands, one
who has lived.” I bowed again in melancholy admission
of the fact. “It will be hard to go.”</p>

<p>He looked really troubled. His handsome warmly-tinted
face wore an expression of gravity that
made him seem much older. His eyes, usually alert
and full of laughter, were wistfully dejected.</p>

<p>“I have loved her,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>For the first time in our acquaintance it seemed
to me that the count was speaking from that center
of feeling that we call the heart. He appeared no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>longer an irresponsible, almost elfish youth, but a
man who, as he himself expressed it, had lived. I
was impressed.</p>

<p>“Have you told her?” I asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head murmuring:</p>

<p>“I decide to and I put it off. It is too hard. I
fear what I may say.”</p>

<p>A sudden idea took possession of me. Writing
it down in cold blood it sounds like the deranged
fancy of a lunatic. At the moment when it came, I
regarded it not only as a possible solution of all our
difficulties, but as an inspiration. My only excuse
is that self-preservation is the law of nature. I was
drowning and I caught at a straw.</p>

<p>“Do you really love Lizzie Harris?” I asked in
a voice tense to the trembling point.</p>

<p>“Very really.”</p>

<p>“More than that other lady, the thin one who wore
the fur dress?”</p>

<p>“Much more.”</p>

<p>“More than any woman you have ever known?”</p>

<p>“A hundred times more.”</p>

<p>We must have presented an absurdly solemn appearance,
I planting my questions like a detective
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>administering the third degree, the count nodding
automatically as he jerked out his answers, his eyes
fixed on me with an almost fierce stare.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you marry her?”</p>

<p>That was my inspiration. It seems to me the most
inexplicable aberration that ever seized a sane
woman&mdash;only for the moment I wasn’t sane. One of
the curious points about it was that I never thought
of Lizzie at all, whether she would want him or not.
All I saw was the count transformed into a genie,
unexpectedly come to my aid. I make no doubt if
she had shown reluctance I would have counseled
him to kidnap her as his ancestors kidnaped the
Sabine women.</p>

<p>His expression brought me back to sense. He
was looking at me with a blank unbelieving surprise
as if I had suggested something beyond the limits
of human endeavor. If I had urged him to inaugurate
a conspiracy against his king or an exploring
party to the moon, he could not have appeared
more astonished.</p>

<p>“Marry her!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Yes, marry her. You love her, you’ve just
said so.”</p>

<p>“Most assuredly I do, to distraction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“Then why do you look so surprised?”</p>

<p>“But marriage&mdash;me?” He laid a finger on his
breast and tapped on the top button of his waistcoat,
regarding me from beneath raised brows. His expression
was that of an intelligent person who can
not believe that he has heard aright. It made me
angry.</p>

<p>“Yes, you. I could hardly be alluding to anybody
else after what you’ve just said.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear lady&mdash;” he sent a roving glance
round the room as if hunting for some one who
would explain, then came back to me. As he met
my eyes he smiled, deprecatingly, almost tenderly,
the smile with which maturity greets the preposterous
antics of a child. “Is it a joke you make?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not,” I answered, “and I don’t see why
you should think it was. When you love a person
you marry them, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Alas, not always. I could never marry Miss
Harris. She is not of my order.”</p>

<p>“Order?” I was the one who ejaculated now.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Whomever I may love I only marry
in my order.”</p>

<p>My inspiration collapsed, pierced by this unexpected
and unfamiliar word. For a moment we sat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>regarding each other. I don’t know how I looked
but I don’t think it could have been as abject as I
felt or the count, who is one of the most amiable
of youths, would have wanted to know what was the
matter. If I had had my wits about me I should
have pretended it was a joke but I was too ashamed
and crushed to pretend anything. In the embarrassing
pause I tried to smile, a feeble propitiatory
smile, which he answered in kind, brightly and reassuringly.
I saw he expected me to go on, and I
didn’t know how to go on except to argue it out
with him.</p>

<p>“What does your order matter if you love a
person?”</p>

<p>“But everything. It is, as you say here, what
we’re there for.”</p>

<p>“But you do marry out of your class. Italian
nobles have married American women who were
without family.”</p>

<p>He gave a gay smile, jerking his head with a little
agreeing movement toward his shoulder:</p>

<p>“Ah, truly, yes, but with fortunes&mdash;large fortunes.
We need them, we have not got the huge
moneys in Italy that you have here. But the adorable
Miss Harris has nothing. Figure to yourself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>Mrs. Drake; she must work for her living. If I come
home to my father with a story like that, what happens?
He is enraged, he turns me out&mdash;and then <i>I</i>
have to work for <i>my</i> living.” He gave a delightful
boyish laugh. “At what?&mdash;pasting letters in a
book? That is all I know.”</p>

<p>“Foreigners are very hard for Americans to understand,”
I muttered, wondering if any foreigner
of any race would ever have understood why a respectable
American widow should offer her friend
in marriage to an unwilling Italian count.</p>

<p>He leaned from his chair, pointing the smoking
cigarette at me. His melancholy had vanished. He
was a boy again, a light-hearted Latin boy, intrigued
and amused at the sentimental point of view
obtaining under the stars and stripes.</p>

<p>“It is you who are hard for us to understand&mdash;so
loving money and so loving love. And which
you like the best we can’t find out. For us one is
here and one is there.” He pointed with the cigarette
to two opposite corners of the room. “Miss Harris
I adore but I do not marry her.” He planted his
romance in the left-hand corner with a jab of his
cigarette. “And I marry a lady whom I may not
love, but who has fortune and who is of my class.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>He planted her in the opposite corner with a second
jab. “They are so far apart.” And he waved the
cigarette between the two, with a sweep wide enough
to indicate the distance that severed sentiment from
obligation.</p>

<p>That was the end of it. I pulled myself together
and led the conversation into a comparison of national
characteristics. I don’t know what he thought
of me, probably that I was a horrible example of
what can be produced by a romance-ridden country.</p>

<p>When I think of it now (if I cared a farthing
what happened to me) I would be quite scared. I
wonder if I’ve inherited a queer strain from any of
my forebears. They don’t look like it, but you can’t
tell from portraits and miniatures. In their days
it was the fashion to paint out all discreditable characteristics
as, in ours, it is the highest merit to paint
them in. Could it be possible that one of those pop-eyed,
tight-mouthed women ever swerved from “a
sweet reasonableness” and bequeathed the tendency
to me? I’ve read somewhere that while the inclination
to wrong-doing may not be transmitted, the
weakened will can pass on. Is my lunacy of to-day,
my distracted waverings, my temptations to disloyalty,
the result of some one else’s lapse from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>normal? (The lamp’s going out. With the room
getting dim I can see the moonlight in a clear wash
of silver on the windows.) It wasn’t the little
Huguenot lady. But her husband opposite, the formidable
Puritan in the wig, was one of the jury
who condemned the witches. That may be it. His
cruelty is coming back to be paid for by his descendant&mdash;the
poor old witches are getting even at last.
Perhaps my descendants will some day writhe in
atonement for my faults. But I have no descendants!
I never will have.</p>

<p>It’s the lamp’s last sputter&mdash;going out as I’m going
out. In a minute it will be dark, with the moonlight
filling the gulfs of the backyards and I, alone
in the night, listening to the stillness, wondering
if I was only created to be an expiatory offering.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> soon as Betty heard that the European offer
was refused she turned her attention to the
lessons. Bustling about, making appointments, talking
over reluctant mothers, forcing people to study
singing who never thought of doing so, she is an
inspiring sight to everybody but the object of her
campaign.</p>

<p>Lizzie makes me uneasy. She has shown no enthusiasm,
taking it all for granted as though busy
ladies could not better employ their time than by
helping her to fortune. Betty thinks it timidity,
that she is distrustful of herself. I know better.
Her languor conceals a dreary disinclination. She
has never said a word of thanks to Betty or Mrs.
Ashworth. Once or twice I have suggested that
they have taken a good deal of trouble and she
might&mdash;I have always stopped there and she has
never asked me to go on. What is the good of telling
a person they ought to have feelings which nature
seems to have left out of them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>Last night Roger came and after a few moments
with me suggested that we go up-stairs and talk over
the new work with her. I wouldn’t, said I was sleepy
and wanted to go to bed. When he had gone I
lowered the lights and sat waiting to hear his footsteps
coming down. I waited an hour and a half,
and then they came, descending the creaking staircase,
passing my door, and going on to the street.
That wasn’t a good night for sleeping. In the small
hours I got up and tried to read. The book was
painfully appropriate, <i>The Love Letters of Mademoiselle
de Lespinasse</i>. I read them till I heard the
milkman making his rounds.</p>

<p>There is something horribly humiliating about
women’s love-letters. When the passion is unrequited,
or half requited as it was with De Lespinasse,
they are so abject. She made a brave stand,
poor soul, tried to find Guibert a wife and pretend
she didn’t mind. But when she began to sicken
to her death, all her bravery vanished. Those last
letters are like a shrill frenzied wail. And she was
a very first-class woman in love with a very second-class
man. I suppose it’s a sort of sex tradition
that we should adore and adhere in this ignominious
way. We’ve had it hammered into us that to love
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>and cling was our mission till it’s grown to have a
fictitious value, and we feel if we don’t love and
cling something is wrong with us. And what’s accomplished
by it&mdash;who is benefited by our useless
suffering?</p>

<p>The other evening down-town in the dusk I passed
a girl waiting on the corner by a show-window.
The light fell full on her face and I knew by her expression
why she was there&mdash;a rendezvous with her
young man who was late. She was angry, close-lipped
and sullen-eyed. I could read her thoughts&mdash;she
was going to tell him her opinion of him, be
haughty and frigid, give him a piece of her mind
and leave him. Just then he came slouching up, a
lowering surly cub, and when she saw him she
couldn’t hide her joy. Her anger vanished at his
first word. She’d have believed anything he told
her knowing in her heart it was a lie. She hardly
wanted his excuses, so glad he’d come, so pitifully
slavishly glad.</p>

<p>It’s shameful, crushing, revolting. Here am I,
the heir of all the ages in the foremost files of time,
feeling just the same as that subjugated shop-girl.
Roger up-stairs with Lizzie, and I can’t sleep, and
can’t eat, and can’t stop caring, and worst of all, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>he wanted to come back to me I’d open my arms
to him. Talk of the forward march of women!
When the cave man went forth to find a new wife,
the old discarded one left in the corner by the fire
felt just the same as I do in the opening of the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>But now, as Pepys says, to bed. I’ll sleep if I
have to take a thumping dose of trional which I
was taught in my youth was even more wicked than
powdering your nose.</p>

<p>This afternoon Lizzie went forth to give her first
lesson and I stayed in to wait for her. I was anxious
about it. If the survival of the fittest prevails among
educators as it does in the animal kingdom I felt
sure that Lizzie as a teacher would not survive. Her
pupil is the spoiled child of fortune, sixteen, with
a voice as small as her <i>dot</i> will be large. Betty had
conjured me to make our protégée give up the black
tea-tray hat and I had tried and failed. Before her
haughty and uncomprehending surprise I had
wilted. No one would have had the courage to
tell her why she should look meek and unassuming.
As it was she had dressed herself with unusual care,
even to the long green earrings which I hadn’t seen
for months. She was more like the duchess in an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>English comedy cast for Broadway, than a penniless
music teacher being pushed up the ladder.</p>

<p>As I sat waiting Miss Bliss came in&mdash;wrapped in
the Navajo blanket. She threw it back and stood
for me to admire, very dainty in a new pink blouse
with a Pierrot frill encircling her neck and a broad
pink ribbon tied round her head. Boyishly slender,
her arms extended to hold out the blanket, she had
the fragile grace of a Tanagra figurine&mdash;a modern
Tanagra with a powdered nose and a dash of carmine
on the lips. When I told her she was pretty she
blushed, dropped the blanket on the floor and herself
on the blanket, and said a girl owed it to herself
always to look her best.</p>

<p>“You might meet a man in the hall,” she murmured,
mechanically reaching for the poker, “and
what’s the sense of looking like a slob?”</p>

<p>When she poked the fire a belt held down the
back of the blouse. The kimono jacket, the safety
pin and the golden corset string were gone, if not
forever, at least till their owner was safely landed
in her own little flat with her own little husband.</p>

<p>Our gossiping stopped when we heard Lizzie’s
step on the stairs. She entered without knocking,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>sweeping in and slamming the door. A brusk
nod was all Miss Bliss got and my greeting was a
curt “Hello, Evie.” She threw herself into a rocker,
and extending her feet beyond the hem of her
skirt, sunk down in the chair and looked at her
boots. In her hand she held a bunch of unopened
letters.</p>

<p>I was keyed up for something unusual but I
hadn’t seen her in this state since her illness. We
waited for her to speak, then as she showed no inclination
to do so I remarked, with labored lightness:</p>

<p>“Well, Lizzie, how was it?”</p>

<p>“Beastly,” she answered, without looking up.</p>

<p>“Was your pupil a nice girl?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Was she disagreeable?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I detested her. A little, simpering,
affected idiot. <i>Sing</i>&mdash;that fool!”</p>

<p>She lifted her head and looked round the room
with a wild and roving eye. Her glance, raised
high, avoided us as if the sight of her fellow humans
was disagreeable. Miss Bliss cleared her
throat and stirred cautiously on the blanket. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>knew where Lizzie had been and was exceedingly
anxious to hear her adventures in the halls of
wealth, but didn’t dare to ask.</p>

<p>“It really isn’t of any consequence what she’s
like,” I soothed. “Just take her as a matter of business.”</p>

<p>“Matter of business!” She struck her hands on
the arms of the chair with a slapping sound and
jumped up. “What have I to do with business?”
Then she walked to the window and stood drumming
with her fingers on the pane.</p>

<p>The quick nervous tattoo fell ominously on my
uneasiness. Miss Bliss sent a furtive masonic look
at me, and glanced away. With an elaborate air of
nonchalance she patted her frill and picked at her
skirt, and finally, unable to stand the combined pressure
of our silence and her own curiosity, said
boldly:</p>

<p>“What kind of a house was it?”</p>

<p>Lizzie answered slowly, pronouncing each word
with meticulous precision:</p>

<p>“It was a large, shiny, expensive house. It was
a hideous house. Nobody who was anything, or
ever expected to be anybody, ought to go into such
a house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t say!” exclaimed Miss Bliss, artlessly
amazed. “I read about it in the papers and they
said it cost millions and had things in it out of
kings’ palaces.”</p>

<p>To this there was no response, and Dolly Bliss
and I began to talk together. We chose a safe topic&mdash;a
bargain sale of stockings at Macy’s. We tried
to invest it with a careless sprightliness, which was
difficult, not so much because of the subject but by
reason of the tattoo on the pane. It was like an
accompaniment out of tune. We couldn’t seem to
give our minds to the stockings while it went on,
even when we raised our voices and tried to drown
it. Suddenly it stopped and we stopped, too, dropping
the stockings and eying each other with fixed
stares. Each of us was determined not to look at
Lizzie and it took all our will to refrain.</p>

<p>She began moving about behind us, and we tried
a new subject&mdash;the count’s approaching departure.
We said nice things about him, echoed each other.
I remarked that he was a charming person, and Miss
Bliss remarked that he was a <i>very</i> charming person.
We had to make a great effort. It was almost impossible
to keep it up with that woman padding
about behind your chair like an ill-tempered tiger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>When a sudden unexpected sound of tearing paper
came from her, I jumped as if the tiger had made
a spring at me. She was opening one of her letters.
It loosened the tension. We suppressed gasps and
took up the count again, more as if he was a human
being and less as if he was the center piece at a dull
dinner-party. Lizzie’s voice, loud and startled,
stopped us.</p>

<p>“What do you think of this&mdash;Mrs. Stregazzi’s
married Berwick!”</p>

<p>The count fled from our minds like an offended
god. We ejaculated, “Berwick!&mdash;Mrs. Stregazzi!”
and sat stunned.</p>

<p>Lizzie consulted the letter:</p>

<p>“Last week in Portland, Maine. She says, ‘We’re
as happy as clams and everybody predicts a great
future for Dan.’”</p>

<p>“Well!” I breathed and looked at the other two.
Lizzie’s temper was gone, a shared sensation made
her one with us.</p>

<p>“Did you ever!” she murmured as any ordinary
young woman might have done.</p>

<p>“Why she’s fifteen years older than he is.”</p>

<p>“More like twenty. She’s not so young as she
looks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>“Good gracious, how extraordinary!” I fell
back in my chair aghast before this evidence of a
woman’s daring. “And those two children, <i>and</i>
the grandmother!” Mrs. Stregazzi’s dauntless
courage began to pale when I compared it to the
bridegroom’s.</p>

<p>“Maybe he wanted a home,” Miss Bliss hazarded.</p>

<p>“A man may want a home but he doesn’t want a
ready-made family in it.”</p>

<p>It was my place in the trio to voice the sentiments
of that staid and unadventurous middle class, which
is described as “the backbone of the country.”</p>

<p>“Singers don’t want homes,” said Lizzie, “they’re
in the way.”</p>

<p>“It must have been love,” I said in an awed voice.
“Nothing else could explain it.”</p>

<p>For a moment we were silent, each deflecting her
glance from the other to an adjacent object. I don’t
know why it should have been, but Mrs. Stregazzi’s
reckless act seemed to have depressed us. Any one
coming into the room would have said we had had
bad news.</p>

<p>Miss Bliss broke the spell, emerging from depths
of thought in which she had been evolving a working
hypothesis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>
<p>“I don’t see why it is so strange,” she said ponderingly.</p>

<p>“You don’t?”&mdash;the backbone of a country in
which all men are free and equal does not bend
readily&mdash;“with that disparity and he just beginning
his career?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.” She was sitting cross-legged,
holding an ankle in each hand and rocking gently.
“I’ll tell you just what I think&mdash;I believe they were
lonely. Lots of people get married because they’re
lonely.”</p>

<p>“She had a mother and two children.”</p>

<p>“She took care of them, they weren’t companions.
Berwick’s a companion, likes what she does and
works at the same thing. It’s great to have a person
like that around.” She nodded, with shrewd
eyes shifting from one face to the other. “I’ve
seen a lot and I’ve noticed. All sorts of people get
married, and it comes out right. It’s not just the
young ones and suitable ones that pull it off. It’ll
be fine for Mrs. Stregazzi to have him to go round
with, and it’ll be fine for him to have her to think
about and talk things over with.”</p>

<p>“They can help each other along in their work,”
I admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>“They can be fond of each other,” said Miss
Bliss.</p>

<p>She ceased rocking and looked out of the window,
the shrewd eyes growing dreamy. Our appearance
of depression returned, a shade darker than before.
Mrs. Stregazzi and Berwick might have shown a
dashing disregard for public opinion, but there was
no reason for us to look as if we had heard of their
mutual destruction in a railway accident. If we
had been waiting for their mutilated remains we
couldn’t have appeared more melancholy. Miss
Bliss heaved a sigh and observed:</p>

<p>“It’s a great thing to have some one fond of you.”</p>

<p>Lizzie and I didn’t answer, but we gave ear as if
the Delphic oracle had spoken and we were trying
to extract balm from its words.</p>

<p>“And it’s a great thing to be fond of some one
yourself.”</p>

<p>Our silence gave assent, but the oracle’s wisdom
did not seem to cheer us. We sat sunk in our chairs,
eying her morosely. Her imagination roused, she
ranged over the advantages of the married state:</p>

<p>“Just think how lovely it would be to know there
was some one who cared whether you were sick or
well, or happy or blue. Wouldn’t it be great to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>have some one come home in the evening who was
going to be awfully glad to see you and who you
were just crazy to have come? And when work
was slack and you were losing your sleep about
money, wouldn’t it be grand to know there was a
feller who could chip in and pay the bills? Oh,
gee&mdash;” she dropped her eyelids with the ecstatic
expression of one who glimpses ineffable radiances.
“Well, I guess yes.”</p>

<p>An answering “yes” came faintly from me. The
ecstatic expression flashed away, and she turned, all
brusk negation:</p>

<p class="p2b">“Oh, Mrs. Drake, <i>you</i> don’t know what it is.
<i>You’re</i> well fixed with money of your own. But
girls like us”&mdash;she pointed to Lizzie, then brought
her finger back to her own knee upon which she
tapped in bitter emphasis&mdash;“<i>we’ve</i> got only ourselves.
We’ve <i>got</i> to make good or go under. And
it’s fight, fight, fight. I’ve had to do something I
hated since I was sixteen and now she”&mdash;with a
nod at Lizzie, “has got to do something she hates.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a id="i_270"><img src="images/i_270.jpg" width="350" alt="“How lovely it would be to know there was some one who cared!”"
title=""  /></a></div></div>

<p class="caption">“How lovely it would be to know there was some one who cared!”</p>

<p class="p2">Lizzie, sunk in the chair, eyed her like a brooding
sphinx. She met the gaze with the boldness
of the meek roused to passion:</p>

<p>“You do hate it, Miss Harris. You’ve done as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>good as say so. And it’s new now, you’re only beginning.
Wait till you come home every evening,
disgusted with it all and everything and everybody;
when it’s bad weather and you feel sick and nobody
cares. Wait till you have to stand anything they
hand out to you, and not say a word back or you’ll
lose your job. I know. I’ve tried it and it’s tough.
It’s too much. Any man that ’ud come along and
offer to take you out of it would look all right to
you.” Her boldness began to weaken before that
formidable gaze. She became hurriedly apologetic.
“I’m not saying there <i>is</i> any man. I’m only supposing.
And I don’t mean now. I mean after
you’ve been up against it for years and years and
the grind’s crushed the heart out of you.”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and the oracle, now openly
scared at her temerity, scrambled to her feet. In
the momentary silence I heard the distant bang of
the street door. She heard it too and forgot her
fear, wheeling to the mirror for a quick touching
up of her hair ribbon and frill. When she turned
back her color had risen to match her reddened lips
and her manner showed a flurried haste.</p>

<p>“I got to go&mdash;several things to attend to&mdash;my supper
and some sewing to finish.” She didn’t bother to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>be careful of excuses. The man who hoped to acquire
the legal right to pay her bills was waiting
below. She went, trailing the Navajo blanket from
a hanging hand.</p>

<p>Lizzie drew a deep breath and said:</p>

<p>“She’s right.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“About me.”</p>

<p>“You mean the teaching?”</p>

<p>“I do. It’s a dog’s work.”</p>

<p>She rose and faced me, sullen as a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>“But you’ve hardly tried it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried it enough. There are plenty of women
who can scratch along that way and be thankful
to Providence and pleasant to the pupils. Let them
do it. It’s their work, not mine.”</p>

<p>She turned from me and went to the window,
but not this time to drum on the pane. Leaning
against the frame she looked out on the tin roof.
The angry contempt of her face suggested that the
millionaires Betty was collecting were gathered
there, unable to escape, and forced to hear how low
they stood in the opinion of their hireling.</p>

<p>“I am an artist. Those people,” she made a
grandiose gesture to the tin roof, “don’t know what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>an artist is. They think they’re condescending, doing
a kindness. <i>I’m</i> the one that’s condescending&mdash;I
do them not a kindness but an honor, when I enter
their houses and listen to the squawking of their
barbarous children.”</p>

<p>“You can’t expect them to think that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, they haven’t got sense enough. That
woman, the mother, came in while I was there. I’ve
no doubt she thought she was being very agreeable.
She asked me questions about my method.” She
gave me a sidelong cast of her eye full of derision.
“I sat and listened, and when she was done I said
I didn’t discuss my method with people who knew
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lizzie,” I groaned. “You didn’t say that?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I did. Only that. I was polite and patient.
If I hadn’t felt so disgusted and out of
spirits I’d have spoken to her freely and fully. But
it wasn’t worth while.”</p>

<p>“But they won’t stand that sort of thing. They
won’t have you again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to go again. I couldn’t endure
it for five minutes. I’d rather sweep a crossing on
Lexington Avenue.”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any crossings on Lexington Avenue,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>and if there were, you don’t know how to sweep.
What will you say to Mrs. Ferguson and Mrs. Ashworth?”</p>

<p>She shrugged with an almost insolent indifference.</p>

<p>“I’ll say I don’t like it. That’s enough, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Lizzie, I beg of you to be reasonable. They
won’t go on helping you if you disappoint them like
this.”</p>

<p>“Then they can stop helping me&mdash;I’m not so immensely
charmed and interested in them. They try
and force me into things I don’t want to do. They
take it out of my hands and then come smiling at
me and say it’s all arranged. So it is&mdash;to their
liking but not to mine.”</p>

<p>“It’s your profession, the only thing you know.
What else could they do?”</p>

<p>“Let me alone.”</p>

<p>It was like beating yourself on a brick wall. I
felt frantic.</p>

<p>“But <i>what’s</i> going to become of you? You’ve got
no means of livelihood.”</p>

<p>She shrugged again.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But one thing I do know and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>is that I won’t do slave’s work for you, or Mrs.
Ferguson, or any one else in the world.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say. I might go on talking
all night and not make a dent on her. Demosthenes
would have turned away baffled before her
impossible unreasonableness.</p>

<p>It was getting dark and I could see her as a tall
black silhouette against the blue dusk of the window.
There was only one suggestion left.</p>

<p>“Are you going to take Dolly Bliss’s advice and
marry?” My voice sounded unnatural, like somebody else’s.</p>

<p>“Marry?” she echoed absently. “I suppose I
<i>could</i> do that.”</p>

<p>“Is it that you can’t make up your mind, Lizzie?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she murmured again, this time
as if she wasn’t thinking of what she said.</p>

<p>I rose with shaking knees. It was the critical
moment of her fate and mine.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to?” I almost whispered, drawing near her.</p>

<p>Her answer made me stop short. It came with a
tremor of fierce inner feeling, revolt, rage and desperation,
seething into expression:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“Oh God, how I hate it all!”</p>

<p>“Hate what&mdash;marriage?”</p>

<p>“No, everything that’s around me. Those women,
this damnable work&mdash;no money&mdash;no hope! I’m
crazy with the misery of it. It’s like being bound
down and smothered. I want to get out. I want to
be free. I want to do what I like and be myself.
You’re trying to make me into some one else. You’re
crushing me and killing me. I’d rather be dead in
my grave than go on this way.”</p>

<p>She burst into frantic tears, savage, racking,
snatching the curtain about her and sobbing and
strangling behind it. The room was nearly dark and
I could see the long piece of drapery swaying as she
clutched it to her. I tried to pluck it away, and
through its folds, felt her body shaken and bent like
a tree in a tempest. I had never heard such weeping,
moans and wails, with words coming in inarticulate
bursts. I was frightened, caught her
hand and drew her out of the curtain which hung
askew from torn fastenings. She pushed me away
and threw herself on the sofa, where, under the vast
circumference of her hat, she lay prone, abandoned
to the storm.</p>

<p>I stood helplessly regarding her, then as broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>sentences came from under her hat, took out the pins
and held it before me like a shield, while she gasped
in choked reiteration that we were killing her, that
she hated us all, that she’d rather die than give another
lesson. If her paroxysm hadn’t been so
devastating I would have lost my temper at the outrageous
injustice of such sentences as I could catch.
I tried to say something of this in a tempered form,
but she shut me off with an extended hand, beating
it at me, calling out strangled execrations at Betty
and Mrs. Ashworth and the mother of her pupil.
If any one who did not know the situation had heard
her, they would have thought those worthy and disinterested
women had been plotting her ruin.</p>

<p>There was nothing for me to do but wait till her
passion spent itself, which it began to do in sighs
and quivering breaths that shook her from head to
foot. When I saw it was moderating I told her I
would get her some wine and went to the kitchenette,
leaving her with drenched face and tangled hair, a
piteous spectacle. In a few moments I was back
with the wine-glass. The room was empty&mdash;she had
gone leaving the black hat.</p>

<p>I picked it up and sat down on the sofa. We certainly
had got to the climax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>I didn’t count&mdash;with my hundred and sixty-five
dollars a month. I could retire into any corner, and
live forgotten and love forlorn like Mariana. But
Lizzie&mdash;? She couldn’t sing, she wouldn’t teach,
nobody could help her. Marriage was the only way
out. As I sat on the sofa, absently staring at the
hat, I had a memory of a corral I had seen at a
railway station in a trip I once took to the West.
It was a pen for the cattle that came off the range
and had to be driven into the cars. The entrance
was wide, but the fenced enclosure narrowed and
narrowed until there was only one way of exit left,
up a gangway to the car. The comparison wasn’t
elegant but it struck me as fitting&mdash;Lizzie was on
the gangway with the entrance to the car the only
way to go.</p>

<p>“I wish to heaven she’d hurry and get into it,”
I groaned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> haven’t</span> seen her for two days. Yesterday
morning I went up-stairs to leave the hat, found
her door open and her rooms empty. Emma says
she has been out most of the time. I waited in all
afternoon, expecting to hear Betty on the telephone
in a state of wrath about the pupil. Also I had my
ear trained for the postman’s light ring. At any
moment I might get a letter now from Roger, announcing
his engagement. Why should not Lizzie’s
absences abroad be spent in walks with him?</p>

<p>As usual the anticipated didn’t happen. Betty did
telephone but in amiable ignorance of her protégée’s
revolt. She had run to earth a second pupil, who
would be ready the following morning at eleven.
Would I please tell Lizzie and did I know how the
first lesson had gone? I prevaricated&mdash;I can do
that at the telephone when Betty’s stern gaze is not
there to disconcert me. I was really afraid to tell
her, and besides, I, too, was getting rebellious. Let
Lizzie manage her own affairs and fight her own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>fights. I said cheerfully she would tell Betty about
it, and hung up the receiver wondering what would
happen. Then I wrote a note to Lizzie about the
new pupil, went up-stairs, knocked, and getting no
response, pushed it under the door.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day I sat waiting like a prisoner
in the death cell.</p>

<p>This morning, when I leaned out of the back
window and looked down on the damp soil and
bare shrubs of the yard, I felt the first soft air of
spring. The sunlight slanted on the brick walls, the
wet spots on the walk around the sun-dial shrunk as
I watched them. On the top of a fence a scarred
and seasoned old cat, at which Mr. Hamilton was
wont to throw beer bottles, stretched lazily, blinking
at a warm inviting world. I leaned farther out&mdash;tiny
blunt points of green were pushing through
the mold along the walk. Mrs. Phillips, sure in
her ownership of the yard, had planted crocuses.
Winter wasn’t lingering in the lap of spring&mdash;he
had jumped off it at a bound.</p>

<p>I turned from the window and went into the front
room, wondering vaguely why winter should always
be a male and spring a female. The tin roof was
dry, the hot bright sun had licked up the sparrow’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>bath. Across the street a line of women from the
tenements were advancing on the park, pushing
baby carriages&mdash;buxom broad-hipped mothers with
no hats and wonderful coiffures of false hair. It
was a glorious morning, the air like a thin clear
wine. I put on my things and went out.</p>

<p>The street showed sunny and clear, fair bright
avenues inviting the wayfarer to wanderings. Children
sped by in groups and scattering throngs.
Smart slim ladies strolled with dogs straining at
leashes. Friends met and stood in talkative knots,
motors flashed by attended by the fluttering of
loosened veils. On the fringe of benches along the
park wall the idle sunned themselves, lax and lazy.
Down-town, where the women shop, men would be
selling arbutus at the street corners. Soon naughty
boys with freckled noses would trail in hopeful
groups along the curb, holding up stolen lilacs to
ladies in upper windows&mdash;yes, spring had come.</p>

<p>I bought a bunch of daffodils at the florist’s and
went into the park. The first hint of green was faint
on the lawns, and points of emerald were breaking
out along the willow boughs. Through the crystal
air the sounds of children at play came musically&mdash;little
yaps and squeals and sudden sweet runs of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>laughter. The glass walls of the casino were
a-dazzle, and revolving wheels caught the sun and
broke it on their flying spokes.</p>

<p>I was near the lake when I saw Lizzie. She was
walking up a side path that crossed mine, her head
down, her step quick and decided. She didn’t see
me and I stood and waited. Then her eye, deep and
absorbed, shifted, caught me, and she came to an
abrupt halt. For the first startled moment there
was an indecision about her poised body and annoyed
face that suggested flight. If I did not share
her dismay, I did her surprise. This was the hour
set for the second lesson. Of course she might have
told Betty that she would give no more, also she
might have been hastening to the tryst with the new
pupil. You never could tell. In answer to my
smiling hail she approached, not smiling but looking
darkly intent and purposeful.</p>

<p>“Which way are you going?” she said, by way
of greeting.</p>

<p>I have been called a tactful person, and acquaintance
with Lizzie has developed what was an untrained
instinct into a ripened art:</p>

<p>“Nowhere in particular. I’m just strolling about
in the sun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Obviously relieved, she said:</p>

<p>“I’m going over there&mdash;” pointing to the apartment-houses
across the park. “I have business on
the west side.”</p>

<p>The new pupil lived on the east side. So she
really had given it up.</p>

<p>“You’ve told Mrs. Ferguson that you won’t give
that lesson&mdash;the one she telephoned about?”</p>

<p>A sudden blankness fell on her face.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get the letter I put under your
door?” I cried in alarm. I couldn’t bear just now,
with everything failing me, to have Betty angry.</p>

<p>She nodded, looking down and scraping on the
ground with her foot. Then slowly raised her eyes,
and glimpsing at me under her lashes, broke into a
broad smile.</p>

<p>“I forgot all about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lizzie! How could you? If you’ve made
up your mind to end it the least you could do was
to let her know. That’s really <i>too</i> bad.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is.” Her hasty contrition was
far from convincing. “Perfectly awful. I ought to
be punished in some painful way. Look here, Evie,
dearest, I’m in a hurry. Why can’t you just pop
into a taxi and go down and explain it to her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you why I can’t, simply and clearly&mdash;because
I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, how provoking of you.” She didn’t
seem at all provoked. Her only concern was to
get away from me and go to the mysterious business
on the west side. She bent sidewise to catch
her skirt and moved away. “Then I will, this evening,
to-morrow morning&mdash;”</p>

<p>I caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>“Lizzie, listen. Mrs. Ferguson is my best friend.
I made her do this and I can’t have you treating
her so rudely. I thought, of course, you’d told her.”</p>

<p>She laid her hand on my detaining fingers, and
as she spoke in her most coaxing manner smoothed
them caressingly, detaching them from their hold.</p>

<p>“Dear girl, I know all that. Every word you
say is true. And I’ll fix it, I’ll straighten it all out.
There won’t be the slightest trouble.”</p>

<p>“Will you telephone those people?” I implored.</p>

<p>My hand was dislodged. She drew away.</p>

<p>“Indeed I will, the first moment I get.” She
paused, arrested by a thought. “What’s their name?
I’ve forgotten.” Then backing off: “<i>You</i> telephone
them. You see I can’t now and I don’t know when
I’ll be near a booth. Say I’m sick, or have left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>town, or anything you like. Just any excuse until
I can attend to it. Good-by. I’ll probably come in
and see you this afternoon.”</p>

<p>She turned and made off as quickly as she could,
a tall vigorous figure, moving with a free swinging
step. I stood and watched her hastening down the
path between the trunks of the bare trees. There
was not a trace upon her of the tempest of two
nights before. It might never have been. Her
whole bearing suggested coursing blood and high
vitality. She was very like the irresponsible and
endearing creature I had known when I first went
to Mrs. Bushey’s.</p>

<p>I gave up my walk and went home to send the
telephone. As I hurried along I wondered where
she could be going and why she seemed so light in
spirit. I was in that feverish state of foreboding
when the simplest events assume a sinister aspect.
The thought crossed my mind that she might be
going to elope with Roger. It would be like her to
elope, and though it would be very unlike him
(about the last thing in the world one could conceive
him doing), he might have become clay in the
hands of that self-willed and beguiling potter.</p>

<p>“Well,” I thought, “so much the better. It’ll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>be over.” And I decided the best thing for me to
do would be to go back to Europe and join the
spinsters and widows in the pensions.</p>

<p>I sent the telephone, trying to soothe an angry female
voice that complained of a morning “utterly
ruined.” I sent another one to Betty, who was also
discomposed, having heard from the mother of “the
barbarous child.” Betty wouldn’t believe her, had
evidently championed the teacher with heat. Betty
is a stalwart adherent, a partisan, and I foresaw
battles in high places.</p>

<p>The afternoon drew to a golden mellow close and
I lay on the sofa waiting for Lizzie. I hadn’t relinquished
the idea of the elopement but it did not
seem so probable as it had in the morning. Anyway,
if she hadn’t eloped&mdash;if she did come in to
see me&mdash;I had made up my mind I would ask her
pointblank what she intended to do about Roger.
It was one word for Lizzie and two for myself. I
really thought if things went on the way they were,
I should go mad. Not that it would matter if
I went mad, for nobody depends on me, nor am I
necessary to the progress or welfare of the state.
But I don’t want to be an expense to my friends.
And I don’t know whether one hundred and sixty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
dollars a month is enough for maintenance in
an exclusive lunatic asylum and I know they would
never send me to any but the best.</p>

<p>When a knock came I started and called a husky
“Come in.” The door opened&mdash;there had been no
elopement. Roger stood on the threshold, smiling
and calm, which I knew he wouldn’t have been if
he was a bridegroom. Marriage would always be
a portentous event with a conscientious Clements.</p>

<p>Whatever I might be with Lizzie I couldn’t be
pointblank with Roger, though I had known him
for fifteen years and her for six months. I explained
my trepidation by a headache and settled
back on the sofa. He was properly grieved and
wanted me to follow Mrs. Ashworth to the south.
I saw myself in a white dress on a hotel piazza being
charming to men in flannels and Panama hats,
and the mere thought of it made me querulous. He
persisted with an amiable urgence. If my opinion
of him hadn’t been crystallized into an unchangeable
form, I should have thought him maddeningly
stupid. I began to wonder, if the present state of
affairs lasted much longer, if I wouldn’t end by
hating him. I was thinking this when Lizzie came in.</p>

<p>I had never seen her, not even in the gladdest days
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>before her illness, look as she did. The old Lizzie
was back, but enriched and glorified. She entered
with a breathless inrush, shutting the door with a
blind blow, her glance leaping at me and drawing
me up from the cushions like the clutch of a powerful
hand. It seemed as if some deadening blight
had been lifted from her and she had burst into
life, enhanced and intensified by the long period of
hibernation. Her lips were parted in a slight, almost
rigid smile, her eyes, widely opened, had lost
their listless softness and shone with a deep brilliance.</p>

<p>Roger gave a suppressed exclamation and rose to
his feet. I think she would have astonished any
man, that Saint Anthony would have paused to look,
not tempted so much as held in a staring stillness
of admiration. She was less the alluring woman
than the burning exultant spirit, cased in a woman’s
body and shining through it like a light through a
transparent shell.</p>

<p>“Lizzie!” I exclaimed on a rising note of question.
I had a sense of momentous things, of a
climax suddenly come upon us all.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to Vignorol,” she said, and came to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>a halt in front of me, her gaze unwavering, her
breast rising to hurried breaths.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Miss Harris,” said Roger,
coming smilingly forward. He had the air of the
favored friend who shows a playful pique at being
overlooked.</p>

<p>The conventional words, uttered in an urbane
tone, fell between us like an ax on a stretched
thread. It can be said for him that he knew Lizzie
too little to realize what her manner portended. He
evidently saw nothing except that she was joyously
exhilarated and looked unusually handsome.</p>

<p>She gave him a glance, bruskly quelling and containing
no recognition of him. It was her famous
piece-of-furniture glance, to which I had been so
often treated. It was the first time Roger had ever
experienced its terrors and it staggered him. In
bewilderment he looked at me for an explanation.
But she was not going to let any outside influence
come between us. I was important just then&mdash;a
thing of value appropriated to her uses.</p>

<p>“I’ve been two days fighting it out, trying to
make up my mind to do it. And this morning,
when you met me, I was going there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” I was aware of that demanding look
of Roger’s, which, getting nothing from me, turned
to her. That was useless, but how was he to know?</p>

<p>“I sang for him,” she said, the brilliant eyes
holding mine as if to grasp and focus upon herself
every sense I had.</p>

<p>“Lizzie!”</p>

<p>The premonition of momentous things grew
stronger. Underneath it, in lower layers of consciousness,
submerged habits of politeness made
themselves felt. I ought to get Roger into the conversation.</p>

<p>“I sang better than I ever did before. And Vignorol,
who used to scold and be so discouraged, told
me I’d got it!”</p>

<p>“Lizzie!”</p>

<p>For a moment we stared at each other, speechless,
she giving the useful pair of ears time to carry
to the brain, the great news.</p>

<p>Then the subconscious promptings grew too strong
to be denied and I said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Clements will be as glad as we are to know
that.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Roger emerged from his astonishment.
He was not as debonair as at the beginning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
also he evidently wasn’t sure just what it
was all about, but he seized upon the most prominent
fact, and said, without enthusiasm, rather with
apprehension:</p>

<p>“This doesn’t mean, Miss Harris, that you’re
thinking of returning to your old profession?”</p>

<p>Her look at him was flaming, as silencing as a
blow. I don’t know why she didn’t tell him to hold
his tongue, except that she was too preoccupied to
waste a word. He flinched before it, drew himself
up and backed away, dazed, as he might have been
if she really had struck him.</p>

<p>Having brushed him aside she went on to me.
The main fact imparted, her exultation burst forth
in a crowding rush of words:</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my voice&mdash;but that’s better, he says it’s
the long rest&mdash;it was the other thing&mdash;the temperament,
the soul. It’s got into me. I knew it
myself as soon as I began to sing. I felt as if something
that bound me was gone&mdash;ropes and chains
broken and thrown away. It was so much easier.
Before I was always making efforts, listening to
what they told me, trying to work it out with my
head. And to-day! Oh, Evie, I knew it, I felt it&mdash;something
outside myself that poured into me and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>carried me along. I could just let myself go and
be wonderful&mdash;wonderful&mdash;wonderful!”</p>

<p>She threw out her arms as if to illustrate the extent
of her wonderfulness, wide as she could stretch,
then brought her hands together on her bosom, and,
with half-shut eyes, stood rapt in ravished memory.</p>

<p>We gazed mutely at her as if she were some remarkable
spectacle upon which we had unexpectedly
chanced.</p>

<p>“I sang and sang,” she said softly, “and each
time it was better. Vignorol wouldn’t let me go.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” I asked.</p>

<p>“He kissed me,” she murmured dreamily.</p>

<p>Roger in his corner moved and then was still.</p>

<p>“But what did he suggest about you? What did
he want you to do?”</p>

<p>My mouth was dry. Sitting on the edge of the
sofa I clutched the sides of it as if it was a frail
bark and I was floating in it over perilous seas.</p>

<p>“Go back to where I belong,” she said, and then
came out of her ecstasy and began to pace up and
down, flinging sentences at me.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Try it again and do it this time. He says I can,
and I know I can. Oh, Evie, to get away from all
this&mdash;those hateful pupils, those hideous lessons&mdash;those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
women! To go back to my work, be among
my own people.” She brushed by Roger, her glance,
imbued with its inward vision, passing over him as
if he was invisible. “It’s like coming out of prison.
It’s like coming to life again after you were dead.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a id="i_293"><img src="images/i_293.jpg" width="350" alt="“I could just let myself go and be wonderful!”"
title=""  /></a></div></div>

<p class="caption">“I could just let myself go and be wonderful!”</p>

<p class="p2">She had expressed it exactly. She <i>had</i> been dead.
The mild and wistful woman of the last two months
was a wraith. <i>This</i> was Lizzie Harris born again,
renewed and revitalized, now almost terrible in her
naked and ruthless egotism.</p>

<p>“What will you do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t thought yet. Vignorol
wants me to study with him for nothing, pay it
back when I make good. But that doesn’t
matter now. I can’t think of anything but that I’m
home, in my place, and that I can do it. They
were all disappointed in me, said I’d never get there.
I can. I will. Wait!&mdash;Watch me. You’ll see me
on top yet, and it won’t be so far off, either. I’ll
show you all it’s in me. I’ll wake up every clod in
those boxes, I’ll make their dull fat faces shine,
I’ll hear them clap and stamp and shout, ‘Brava,
Bonaventura!’”</p>

<p>She cried out the two last words, staring before
her with flashing eyes that looked from the heights
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>of achievement upon an applauding multitude. In
the moment of silence I had a queer clairvoyant
feeling that it was true, that it would happen, and
I saw her as the queen of song with her foot upon
the public’s neck. Then the seeing passion left her
face and her lip curled in superb disdain.</p>

<p>“And you wanted to make a <i>singing teacher</i> out
of me!”</p>

<p>She swept us both with a contemptuous glance,
as if we were the chief offenders in a conspiracy for
her undoing. I was used to it, but Roger, the galled
jade whose withers were yet unwrung, winced under
her scorn.</p>

<p>“But Miss Harris,” he protested, “we only&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not talking to you,” she said brutally.
“You don’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if you say so,” he replied.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause. I did not like to
look at him. You can bear being insulted if no one
else sees it, but one old friend mustn’t witness another’s
humiliation, especially when that other is
unable by temperament and training to hit back.</p>

<p>Lizzie, having crushed him like an annoying and
persistent fly, wheeled toward the door.</p>

<p>“I must go. I can’t stay any longer.” Then in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>answer to a question from me, “Oh, I don’t know
where&mdash;out to breathe. I can’t stay still. I want
to walk and feel I’m free again, that I’m not
cramped up in a dark hole with no sunshine. I want
to feel that I’m myself and say it over and over.”</p>

<p>She went out, seeming to draw after her all the
stir and color that she had brought in. It was as
if a comet with a bright and glittering tail had
crowded itself into the room, and then, after trying
to squeeze into the contracted area, swishing and
lashing about and flattening us against the walls,
had burst forth to continue on its flaming way.</p>

<p>I fell back on the sofa feeling that every nerve
in me had snapped and I was filled with torn and
quivering ends. Stupidly, with open mouth, I
looked at Roger, and he, also stupidly but with his
mouth shut, looked at me. I don’t know how long
we looked. It probably was a few seconds but it
seemed an age&mdash;one of those artificially elongated
moments when, as some sage says, the measure of
time becomes spiritual, not mechanical. I saw Roger
afar as if I was eying him through the big end of
an opera glass&mdash;a tiny familiar figure at the end
of a great vista. The space between us was filled
with a whirling vortex of thoughts, formless and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>immensely exciting. They surged and churned
about trying to find a definite expression, trying to
force their way to my brain and tell me thrilling
and important news. Then the familiar figure advanced,
pressed them out of the way, and taking a
chair by the sofa sat down and demanded explanations.</p>

<p>I couldn’t give them. I couldn’t explain Lizzie
to him any more than I could to Betty or Mrs. Ashworth.
I remembered him, before he had met her,
telling me in the restaurant that I was seeing her
through my own personality, and now <i>he</i> was doing
it, and he’d never get anywhere that way. I wanted
desperately to make him understand. There was
something so pitiful in his dismay, his reiterated
“But why should she be offended with me. What
have <i>I</i> done?” And then hanging on my words
as if I was some kind of a magician who could wave
a wand and make it all clear. Nothing would have
pleased me more than to be able to advance some
“first cause” from which he could have worked up
to a logical conclusion. But how could I? The
lost traveler in the Australian bush was faced by a
task, simple and easy, compared to Roger Clements’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>trying to grasp the intricacies of Lizzie Harris’
temperament.</p>

<p>I was sorry for him. I was sorry (the way you’re
sorry for some one inadequately equipped to meet
an unexpected crisis) to see how helpless he was.
I tried to be kind and also truthful&mdash;a difficult combination
under the circumstances&mdash;and make plain
to him some of the less complex aspects of the
sphinx, only to leave him in dazed distress.</p>

<p>He was alarmed at her evident intention to go
back to the stage, couldn’t believe it, wanted me to
tell him why an abandoned resolution should come
back like a curse to roost. He couldn’t get away
from his original conception of her, had learned
her one way and couldn’t relearn her another. It
was at once a pathetic sight and an illuminating experience&mdash;the
man of ability, the student, the
scholar, out of his depths and floundering foolishly.
The mind trained to the recognition of the obvious
and established, accustomed to fit its own standards
to any and all forms of the human animal, coming
up with a dizzying impact against the mind that
had no guide, no standard, no code, but floats in the
flux of its own emotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>I repeat I was sorry, immensely sorry. Such is
the inconsistency of human nature that I was filled
up and overflowing with sympathy at the spectacle
of my own man, once my exclusive property, hurt,
flouted and outraged by the vagaries of my successful
rival.</p>

<p>A eight o’clock that evening I was in my sitting-room
when I heard her come in. She did not stop
at my door but went up-stairs, a quick rustling
progress through the silence of the house. It was
very still, not a sound from any of the rooms,
when I heard the notes of her piano, and then her
voice&mdash;“<i>Mon cœur s’ouvre à ta voix.</i>” The register
was shut, and I stole to the door and opening it
stood at the stair-head listening. Before the aria
was over I knew that what she had said was true.
Lizzie had found herself.</p>

<p>After a pause she began again&mdash;<i>O Patria Mia</i>
from <i>Aïda</i>. I tiptoed forward and let myself noiselessly
down on the top step, breath held to listen.
As the song swelled, the cry of a bleeding and distracted
heart, the doors along the passages were
softly opened. Up and down the wall came the
click of turned latches and stealthy footsteps. Mrs.
Bushey’s lodgers were not abroad, as I had thought.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>The stairs creaked gently as they dropped upon
them. When <i>Patria Mia</i> was over we were all
there. I could see the legs of Mr. Hamilton and
the count dangling over the banisters above me. On
the bottom of the flight Mr. Weatherby sat, and
Miss Bliss and Mr. Hazard leaned against the wall,
looking up with the gaslight gilding their faces.</p>

<p>In the silence that fell on the last note no one
spoke. There was no rising chorus of praise as
there once had been. I don’t think we were aware
of one another, each rapt in the memory of an
ecstatic sadness. The cautious foot of Mrs. Phillips
stealing along the lower hall made me look down
and I saw her stationing herself beside young
Hazard, and that Dolly Bliss’ face shone with tears.</p>

<p>She went on&mdash;<i>Vissi d’Arte, Vissi d’Amore</i>, Musetta’s
song; the habanera from <i>Carmen</i>, Brahm’s
<i>Sapphische Ode</i>, sounding the depths and heights.
Between each piece we were dumb, only the creaking
of the banisters as Mr. Hamilton shifted, or
the sniffing of Miss Bliss when the song was sad,
fell on our silence. We never saw her. She was
at last the diva, remote, august, a woman mysterious
and unknown, singing to us across an impassable
gulf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>As long as I live I shall never forget it&mdash;the narrow
half-lit passages, the long oval of the stair-well,
on the bottom step of my flight Mr. Weatherby’s
back, broad and bent, as he rested his elbows on his
knees. Against the whitewashed wall below Mr.
Hazard with his eyes fixed in a trance of listening;
Mrs. Phillips, her head pressed back against the
wall, her lids closed, and Dolly Bliss’ little face
bright with slow dropping tears.</p>

<p>We were Liza Bonaventura’s first audience.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIX">XIX</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> next morning, while I yet slept, she came
knocking and rattling at my door. When I
let her in she upbraided me for having it locked, unmindful
of my sleepy excuses that as the street door
was generally open all night it was wisdom to keep
one’s apartment firmly closed.</p>

<p>She was in the blue kimono over her nightgown,
and when I got back into bed&mdash;for it was too early
for breakfast&mdash;sat down on the edge of the couch
and told me that she had decided to accept Mrs.
Ferguson’s offer to send her to Europe.</p>

<p>I had expected some move but hadn’t dared to
hope for this. It was impossible to hide my agitation,
to wipe the expression of startled excitement
off my face. She paid no attention to me, would
not have noticed if I had fallen flat in a dead faint,
so engrossed was she in her plans. Staring out of
the window with narrowed far-seeing eyes, she developed
her program, oblivious of the fact that I
was not answering, more like a person thinking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>aloud than one consulting another. When she finally
paused, I said hoarsely, afraid to believe it:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ferguson may have changed her mind.
You wouldn’t hear of the offer when she made it.”</p>

<p>She treated the suggestion as preposterous.</p>

<p>“What an idea! Who ever heard of any woman
changing her mind on such a subject.”</p>

<p>“You’ve changed yours,” I answered faintly.</p>

<p>“I’m different, and besides I’ve changed it for the
better. She’ll be only too glad to send me. Why
think of what it means to her! She’ll be known as
the patron of one of the greatest living prima
donnas. That’s a thing that doesn’t happen to everybody.
Is the morning paper down-stairs? I want
to see what steamers are leaving this week. I’ll
go as soon as I can get off. Oh, I won’t meet anybody,
and it doesn’t matter if I do.”</p>

<p>The door closed on her and I fell back on the pillows
like a marionette whose wire has broken.
Limp as a rag I lay looking up at the ceiling, and
out of my mouth issued a sigh that was almost a
groan. It was all I had power for. The tension
snapped, I suddenly felt myself invaded by a lassitude
so deep, so vast that it went to the edges of
the world and lapped over. I would like to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>been removed to a far distance and lain under a
tree and watched the leaves without moving or
thinking or speaking. I would like to have stayed
in bed and looked at the dusty circle of cement
flowers from which the chandelier hung, for years
and years.</p>

<p>She came hastening back with the paper, tore it
apart, and spreading it on the table read the shipping
advertisements. Several steamers were due
to sail within the week. She decided on the best and
throwing the paper on the floor, said briskly:</p>

<p>“I’ll see her about it this morning before she goes
out. There’s no need to bother about it before breakfast.
I’ll just take a cup of coffee down here with
you and then go up and dress. Let’s get it now.”</p>

<p>I rose, telling her to set the table while I dressed.
She put on two cups, each trip to the table impeded
by the paper, over which she trampled with loud
cracklings, then she gave it up and followed me,
talking. My toilet, performed with mutilated rites
owing to its publicity, took me from room to room,
with Lizzie at my heels. When I shut the door on
my bath, she leaned against it and through the crack
gave me her opinion on the rival merits of Paris
and Berlin as centers of musical study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>While I was making the breakfast she stood in the
entrance of the kitchenette, then, squeezing by her
with the coffee pot in one hand and a plate of toast
in the other, she did not give me enough room and
the toast slid off the plate and was strewed afar. She
picked up a piece and sat down eating it, her elbows
on the table, while I gathered up the rest. Hot and
disheveled I took my place opposite while she
watched me, biting delicately at her toast, benignly
beautiful and fresh as a summer’s morn.</p>

<p>She was stretching her hand for her cup when a
disturbing thought made her pause. She dropped
the hand and looked at me in consternation:&mdash;her
big trunk was no good, it had been broken three
years ago coming from California.</p>

<p>“Oh, well”&mdash;a happy solution occurred to her
and she held out her hand for the cup&mdash;“I can borrow
one of yours. That large one with the Bagdad
portière over it. I’ll return it as soon as I get there.
You don’t mind loaning it to me, do you, dearest?”</p>

<p>I gave it, warmly, generously, effusively. It
wasn’t like giving Mrs. Bushey the lamp. There
was no necessity for diplomatic pressure. I would
have given her my jewels, my miniatures, my last
cent in the bank, my teeth like Fantine, each and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>all of my treasures, to have her go. Nobody knows
how I wanted her to go. It was not that I had
ceased to love her&mdash;I will do that till I die. It
was not that I had hopes Roger would forget her&mdash;he
may be as faithful as Penelope for all I know.
I was unable to stand any more. I was down, done,
ended. I wanted to creep into my little hole, curl
up and lie still. I wanted to look at the wreath of
cement flowers for years. I wanted immunity from
the solving of unsolvable questions, respite from
trying to straighten out what persisted in staying
tangled, freedom to regain my poise, reinstate my
conscience, patch up the broken pieces of my heart.
An immovable body had encountered an irresistible
force, and though the immovable body was still in
its old place, it had been so scarred and torn and
tattered by the irresistible force that only rest would
restore it.</p>

<p>That was two days ago. In the interim there has
been no rest&mdash;I have spent most of the forty-eight
hours in taxicabs and at telephones&mdash;but relief is
in sight.</p>

<p>Lizzie is going.</p>

<p>It is all arranged. Betty has dispersed the pupils
and renewed her European offer. Between taxicabs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>she caught me here yesterday and told me that few
women have the privilege of being the patron of
one of the greatest living prima donnas. The privilege
sat soberly upon her and she was going to
make herself worthy of it by giving one of the
greatest living prima donnas every advantage that
Europe offers.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Lizzie and I went down to the
steamship office and bought her ticket, and then
to the banker’s to draw the first instalment on her
letter of credit. It was a royally generous letter
and I said so. Lizzie didn’t think it was too much
and went over a list of expenses to prove it. She
is to go to Berlin&mdash;Vignorol wanted Paris but as
a dramatic singer she preferred Berlin. I gathered
from a casual remark that Vignorol was hurt at her
desertion of him and his country. But this didn’t
trouble her.</p>

<p>“Vignorol! I don’t see that it was so kind of him
to want to take me for nothing. It would have
made him. He’s only known here in New York
now and as my teacher he would have been known
all over the world.”</p>

<p>The steamer sails the day after to-morrow and
this afternoon I sent up the trunk. I had offered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>to come in the evening and help her pack and then
backed out. In an offhand manner, as she was
sorting piles of sheet music, she said Roger was
coming in after dinner to say good-by. She seemed
engrossed by the music, gave an absent-minded assent
when I said I couldn’t help that night. I could
not tell whether she had at last guessed and was
exhibiting unusual tact or whether she was still unconscious.
I knew that every minute of the next
day was filled and it would be Roger’s only chance
to see her alone. It was difficult to imagine him
proposing in a room littered with his lady’s wardrobe.
But love is said to find out a way and if a
man’s in earnest he can put the question just as
well in a fourth-floor parlor full of clothes, as he
can by moonlight in a bower.</p>

<p>I had been waiting for this interview, braced and
steeled for the announcement. It was the final trial
and I was going to go through with it proudly and
stoically if I died the day after. I did not feel
quite as if I should die. Hope springs eternal in
the human breast, that’s why we don’t all, sometime
or other, commit suicide. Hope upheld me now:
with a career beckoning she might refuse him. It
was but a sickly gleam. No woman, comprehensible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>to me, would ever put the greatest career the world
offers before Roger Clements. The hope lay in the
fact that Lizzie was not a comprehensible woman.</p>

<p>With great inward struggle I preserved my pride
and stoicism through the rest of the afternoon. They
were still with me when, in the evening I lay down
on the divan bed, whence I can hear all ascending
footsteps. The wreath of cement flowers gradually
faded, and the daylight sounds of the house were
absorbed in the evening quiet. Night had possession
of the city for what seemed an endless time when I
heard him going up: from the street, past my floor,
up the next flight, and the next, then the far faint
closing of Lizzie’s door. Rigid in the dark I pictured
the meeting&mdash;the room with its high blaze
of gas, the open trunks and scattered garments, and
Lizzie with her smile and the enveloping beam of
her glance.</p>

<p>It was profoundly still in the back room, only the
tiny ticking of my watch on the table. The old
tomcat, who at this hour was wont to lift up his
voice in a nuptial hymn, had gone afield for his
wooing. The parlors and bedrooms in the extensions
were quiet, their lighted windows throwing a
soft yellow light into my darkened lair. Our little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>bit of the city held its breath in sympathy with me,
prone with fixed eyes, seeing those two in the parlor.</p>

<p>Would he work up to it in gentle gradations,
gracefully and poetically as men did in novels, or
blurt it out in one great question which (for me
at least) would have made life blossom as the wood
did when Siegmund sung? They would probably
stand&mdash;people didn’t sit when such matters were
afoot&mdash;and if she said yes would he take her in his
arms then and there? Under the same roof, just
two floors above me, they might be standing now,
enfolded, cheek to cheek. Pride and stoicism fell
from me and I pressed my face into the pillow and
moaned like a wounded animal.</p>

<p>The watch ticked on. It was evidently not going
to be short and tempestuous. Roger was an unhurried
person and he would probably proffer his suit
with dignified deliberation. I was certain, if he was
successful, he’d come in and tell me on the way
down. I couldn’t see him passing my door and not
remembering. The place was dark, he might think
I was asleep and go by. I got up and lit the lights,
thinking as I stretched up with the match, that they
were signals telling him I was here, waiting, ready
to wish him joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>Then I looked at the watch&mdash;only just nine. He
might be hours longer. I could spend the time
in preparation, be ready to meet him with a frank
unforced smile.</p>

<p>I went to the back window and looked up at the
stars for courage. The sky was sprinkled with
them&mdash;big ones and bright pin points. For centuries
they had been gazing down at the puny
agonies of discarded lovers, unmoved and cynically
curious, winking at them in derision. The thought
had a tonic effect. Under its stimulus I straightened
my ancestors, askew after a morning’s dusting, and
touched up the bunch of daffodils on the table. Then
the effect began to wear off. I reached for the
watch&mdash;twenty minutes past nine.</p>

<p>If she had refused him it would have been done
by now. Lizzie wasn’t one to spare or mince her
words. I’d better get ready for him. I went to
the mirror and saw a ghost, and the stars’ stern
message was forgotten. That I should some day be
dust was not a sustaining thought now when I was
so much a suffering sentient thing, sunk down in
the midmost of the moment. I brushed some rouge
on my cheeks and smiled at the reflection to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>if I could do it naturally. It was ghastly, like the
grimace of a corpse that had expired in torment.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I dropped my rouge and gave a
smothered cry&mdash;I heard Lizzie calling my name.
For a moment power of movement seemed stricken
from me. I had not thought that she would be the
one to tell me. She called again and I opened
the door and went into the hall. Her head was
visible over the banisters.</p>

<p>“Have you got the key of that trunk?” she said.
“It’s packed and I want to lock it.”</p>

<p>It was a ruse to get me up there. Even Lizzie
wouldn’t announce an engagement at the top of her
voice down two flights of stairs. I found the key
and mounted, holding to the hand-rail. It seemed
a long climb. When I got to the top I had no
breath, though I had gone slowly, and I trembled
so that I was afraid she would notice it, and laid the
key on the table.</p>

<p>The trunk was packed, its lid down, and another,
open, with garments trailing over its sides, stood in
the middle of the floor. Round it lay the unpacked
remains of Lizzie’s wardrobe, in mounds, in broken
scatterings, in confused interminglings. If a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>cyclone had descended on neat closets and bureau
drawers, scooped out their contents, carried it with
a whirling centripetal motion into the center of the
room, took a final churning rush through it and
dashed out again, the place could not have presented
a more wildly disheveled appearance.</p>

<p>In an unencumbered corner, an eddy untouched
by the cyclone’s wrath, Roger stood putting on his
coat. We looked across the chaos, bowed and
smiled. I knew my smile by heart. Roger’s was
something new, rose no higher than his lips, leaving
his eyes somber, I might say sullen. Lizzie, without
words, had snatched up the key and knelt by the
trunk. She looked untidy, hot and rather cross.
They certainly had not the appearance of lovers.</p>

<p>I fell weakly into a chair and awaited revelations.
None came. Roger buttoned his coat, Lizzie made
scratching noises with the key. There was something
strained and sultry in the silence. Could she
have refused him? One of the disappointing things
about people in real life is their failure to rise to the
dramatic expression fitting to great moments. Had
I been in a play I would have used words vibrating
with the thud of my own heart-beats. What I did
say was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>“Have you had a nice evening?”</p>

<p>“Very,” said Roger with a dry note.</p>

<p>“Have we,” murmured Lizzie, busy with the key.
“I’m sure I don’t know. I’ve not had time to say
a word to Mr. Clements.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve been rather in the way,” he remarked,
the dry note a trifle more astringent.</p>

<p>“Well, the truth is you have,” she answered. “Are
you sure this is the right key, Evie?”</p>

<p>The gleam of hope brightened into a ray. I sat
forward on the edge of the chair looking from
Lizzie’s bent back to Roger’s face, which had reddened
slightly and had a tight look about the mouth.
I am, by nature, a shy and modest person, and under
normal conditions the last thing I would do
would be to force another’s confidence. But I <i>had</i>
to know. I had to drag the truth out of them if it
came with a shriek like the roots of the fabled
mandrake.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you talked <i>at all</i>?” I exclaimed, with an
agonized emphasis that might have betrayed me to
a child of twelve.</p>

<p>They did not appear to notice it. Roger moved
from his corner, picking his way round a clump of
boots that had been whirled near the sofa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>“Talk?” said Lizzie, still engaged with the key.
“How can people talk when they’re packing to go
to Europe? There! It’s in and it turns. Thank
goodness the lock’s all right.”</p>

<p>She rose and surveyed the room with an intent
frowning glance.</p>

<p>“That,” pointing to the other trunk, “I’ll begin
on now and finish to-morrow. This,” turning to
the full one, “is done. I’d better lock it at once and
get it out of the way.”</p>

<p>She turned back to it and gave a series of tentative
pushes at the lid which rose rebelliously over
bulging contents.</p>

<p>Nothing had happened! She hadn’t let him speak&mdash;he
hadn’t dared&mdash;no opportunity had offered?
What did it matter how or why? The sickening
thudding of my heart began to grow less. I leaned
my elbow on my knees and my forehead on my
hands, feeling at last as if I was going to be Early
Victorian and swoon.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of my fingers I could see
Roger’s feet stepping carefully among the boots.
Skirting tangled heaps of millinery, they arrived
at the trunk. I dropped my hands and watched
while he addressed himself to Lizzie’s back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>“Good night.” He stretched out his hand. “Good-by.”</p>

<p>She turned, saw the hand and put hers into it;
then, for the first time smiled, but not with her
habitual rich glow.</p>

<p>“Good-by. I’d ask you to stay but there’s really
too much to do. I’ve got to have to-morrow free
to finish up in.”</p>

<p>The hands separated and dropped. His back was
toward me and I was glad of it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’ll meet again some day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, surely.” The abstraction of her look vanished,
her smile flashed out brilliant and dazzling.
“But not here, not this way. You’ll see me soon
in my right place&mdash;behind the footlights.”</p>

<p>He murmured a response and moved toward the
door. She turned back to the trunk, pressing on it
and then drawing back and pressing again. He
passed me with a low “Good night, Evie,” and I
answered in the same tone.</p>

<p>He was at the door when she ceased her efforts,
and drawing herself up with a deep breath, called
peremptorily:</p>

<p>“Come here, Mr. Clements.”</p>

<p>He stopped, the door-knob in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>“What is it, Miss Harris?”</p>

<p>She stood back from the trunk, flushed and irritated.</p>

<p>“Just sit on this trunk, please. It must be locked
to-night.”</p>

<p>Her eye on him was as the eye of a general or a
subaltern, impersonal, commanding, imperious.</p>

<p>He met it and stood immovable. In the fifteen
years I have known him I had never seen him look
so angry.</p>

<p>“Hurry up,” she said sharply. “I’d ask Evie but
she’s not heavy enough.”</p>

<p>He answered with icy politeness:</p>

<p>“Miss Harris, I am very sorry, but I’ve already
stayed too long. There are other men in the house,
who will surely only be too happy to sit on your
trunk whenever you choose to command them,” and
he opened the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, if you’re going to be so disobliging,”
she answered, angry now in her turn.
Then to me: “Come over here, Evie, and help. If
we both press as hard as we can I think we can do
it. I don’t care to wait till the morning. I want
this locked now.”</p>

<p>I rose obediently and began to steer my way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>through the cyclone’s track. Roger came in, shutting
the door with a bang.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Drake’s in no condition to make such exertions.
She’s been ill and oughtn’t to be asked to do
such things. Evie, don’t touch that trunk.”</p>

<p>“That’s perfect rubbish. I’m not asking her to
<i>lift</i> it. Come on, Evie.”</p>

<p>I stopped, looking helplessly from one to the
other. They glared at each other, his face pale,
hers red. They seemed on the verge of battle and I
knew what Lizzie was like when her temper was up.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t fight about a trunk,” I implored.</p>

<p>“I’ve not the slightest intention of fighting about
anything,” said Roger, looking as if, had a suitable
adversary been present, he would have felled him
to the ground. “But I won’t have you making efforts
that are unnecessary and that you’re unable to
make.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a perfect fool,” said Lizzie, with
the flashing eye of combat I knew so well.</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>“I’m quite ready to admit it. But as a perfect
fool I absolutely refuse to let you make Mrs. Drake
help shut that trunk.”</p>

<p>“Then do it yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>As usual she had the best of it. Roger knew it
and bore upon his face the look of the bear in the
pit at whom small boys hurl gibes. When she saw
the symptoms of defeat she began to melt.</p>

<p>“It’ll not take five minutes&mdash;just one good pressure
on this corner. There’s a hat box that sticks
up and has to be squeezed down.”</p>

<p>With a white face of wrath Roger strode over the
clothes and sat on the trunk. I have never believed
that he could be ridiculous, my Roger hedged
round with the dignity that is the Clements’ heritage,
but he was then, boiling with rage, perched uncomfortably
on the sloping lid. A hysterical desire
to laugh seized me and I backed off to my chair,
biting my under lip, afraid to speak for fear of exploding
into a screaming giggle.</p>

<p>They were unconscious of anything funny in the
situation, one too angry, the other too engrossed.
With a concentrated glance she surveyed the trunk,
directing the bestowal of his weight. When she had
finally got him in the right place, she knelt, key in
hand, and in answer to a curt demand he rose and
flopped furiously down. To the protesting crunching
of the hat box, the lid settled and the click of
the lock sounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>“Done,” she cried triumphantly, falling back in
a sitting posture on the floor.</p>

<p>Roger got up.</p>

<p>“Have I your permission to go?” he asked with
elaborate deference.</p>

<p>“You have,” said his hostess, and from the floor
looked up with a bright and beaming face from
which every vestige of bad temper had fled. “Good-by&mdash;good
luck. And remember, the first performance
I give in New York I expect to see you applauding
in the bald-headed row.”</p>

<p>As the door shut on him my laughter came like
the burst of a geyser. Lizzie, still on the floor, looking
at me with annoyed surprise, made it worse.
When she asked me in a hostile voice kindly to tell
her what the joke was, it got beyond my control
and I became hysterical. It wasn’t very bad&mdash;I always
do things in a meek subdued way&mdash;but I
laughed and cried when I tried to explain and
laughed again.</p>

<p>When she saw there was no use ordering me not
to be an idiot, she got up, grumbling to herself and
began on the second trunk. She kept stepping
round me carrying armfuls of clothes, trailing
skirts over my knees, leaning forward from a kneeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
posture to jerk blouses, cloaks and petticoats
from the back of my chair. I tried to retreat into
corners, but she worked in wide comprehensive
sweeps, wherever I went coming after me to find
something that was under my chair or upon which
I was sitting. Finally she used me as a sort of
stand, throwing things on me and plucking them off,
muttering abstractedly as she worked.</p>

<p>I was recovering and she was inspecting a skirt
outheld at arm’s length when she said musingly:</p>

<p>“I hadn’t the least idea Roger Clements was so
bad-tempered. He’s just a self-sufficient cross-grained
prig. Gets into a rage when I ask him to
sit on a trunk. I can’t stand that kind of man.”</p>

<p>I bade her good night and went down-stairs.</p>

<p>The lights were burning high. I put them out
and laid down on the bed. My laughter and tears
were over. Fatigue, anger and pain were sensations
that existed somewhere outside me, in a world
I had left. I seemed to have no body, to be a spirit
loosened from fleshly trammels, floating blissfully
in prismatic clouds.</p>

<p>I floated in them, motionless in ecstatic relief,
savoring my joy, knowing the perfection of peace,
till the windows paled with the dawn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XX">XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> write</span> to-night in a hushed house&mdash;a house
that holds the emptiness that follows the withdrawal
of a dynamic presence.</p>

<p>Lizzie is gone.</p>

<p>As her ship bears her away to future glory, we,
the hewers of wood and drawers of water, sit here
recuperating from the labors of getting her off. In
its hour of departure the magnet gave forth the
full measure of its power and we bent our backs
and lent our hands in a last energy of service. No
votaries bowed before the shrine of a deity ever
celebrated their worship with more selfless acts of
devotion than Mrs. Bushey’s lodgers in speeding
Lizzie on her way.</p>

<p>What did Mr. Hazard’s unfinished order matter
when Lizzie, having forgotten to order the expressman,
one had to be sought up and down the reaches
of Lexington Avenue? Of what consequence to
Miss Bliss were broken sittings, on the proceeds of
which she could have lived for a week, when Lizzie’s
traveling dress was found to be in rags and had to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>be mended by some one who knew how? When the
count rendered his tribute in fruit and flowers, did
he stop to consider that the money was part of the
fund reserved for his passage home, and now he
would have to travel second cabin? No one thought
of anything but the departing goddess. They were
proud and glad to deny themselves that she might
go, grandly serene, amid clouds of ascending incense.</p>

<p>As for me, after that night of respite, I became a
body again, a body whose mission was the preparing
of another for the great adventure. She drew
me after her as the fisherman draws the glittering
bit of tin that revolves from the end of his line. The
simile is not entirely satisfactory because I did not
glitter, but I revolved, round and round, as the
fisherman’s hand pulled or eased on the line. I
sewed, I packed, I unpacked, searching for forgotten
necessities. I was down-town, executing
overlooked errands, I was up-town, cooking hurried
meals in the kitchenette. My voice in the
morning called her to breakfast, my good night was
the last sound on the stairs as I left her room,
grown bare and bleak, losing its character, as one
by one the signs of her occupancy vanished. I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>no time to feel, to be glad or sorry. Even the
passion to have her go was overridden by the ruling
instinct that while she was there I must serve. And
though the poet tells us there are those who can do
this while standing and waiting, I evidently was
not one of them.</p>

<p>As we demonstrated her power by the zeal of
our devotion, her arrogant exactions increased in
a corresponding ratio. She was never more aloof,
more regally indifferent, more imperiously demanding.
The call of her destiny had come to her and
she heard nothing else.</p>

<p>Her stay with us had been only the bivouac of
a night, and we the passers-by she had encountered
in the moment of halt. With the goal in sight we
lost what small significance we had and assumed
the aspect of strangers, by whose fire she had rested,
in whose tent she had slept. Already, before she
had gone, we had faded into the limbo of the useless
and outworn. Henceforward, from our humble
corner, we would watch her mounting on others as
she had mounted on us&mdash;climbing higher and higher
with never a backward glance or a wave of her hand
to the little group who strained their eyes for a sign
of remembrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>Some day the others would find her out and be
angry, cite to their friends proofs of her ingratitude,
grow bitter at the memory of their unappreciated
efforts, add her to the list of forgetful great
ones who took all and rendered nothing back. From
a deeper knowledge of her I would never know their
disillusion. The thought that she felt no love for
any of us had for me no sting. I even went farther,
agreed that it was not her place to feel it. Arrived
at last at the heart of her mystery, I could keep my
memory of her fair and untarnished, untouched by
efforts to fit her into a frame where she didn’t belong.</p>

<p>She was not, as they would think, a heartless and
cruel fellow of ours, but the creature of another
species, thinking in a different language, seeing life
from a different angle. What we were trained to
accept as right and just, she had no power to recognize.
Custom and tradition had formed a groove in
which we walked unquestionably onward. She wandered
at will in a world expressly created for her,
peopled by shades who had no meaning apart from
their usefulness. Environment that had molded
and put its stamp upon us made no impression upon
her invulnerable self-concentration. We held a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>point of view in common, responded automatically
to established ideas and inherited impulses. She
saw no claims but her own and moved upon what
she wanted with the directness of an animal. The
bogies with which we were frightened into good
behavior&mdash;public opinion, social position, loss of
respect&mdash;she snapped her fingers at. Her only law
was the law of her own being, her standard, a fierce
and defiant determination to be true to herself. Restraints
and reticences, subtleties of breeding, delicacies
of conduct, imposed on us by the needs of
communal life, were not for her, selected and set
apart to be that lonely figure in the crowded companionable
world&mdash;the people’s servant.</p>

<p>That was what I at last knew her to be&mdash;an instrument
for the joy, the recreation, the enthrallment
of that great, sluggish, full-fed Minotaur, the
public. For this purpose nature had fashioned her,
eliminating every characteristic that might render
her unfit, pruning away virtues that would hamper,
uprooting instincts that would interfere. As Wordsworth
saw the All-Mother saying of a worthy specimen,
“I will make a lady of my own,” so, seeing
Lizzie, she had said, “I will make an artist of my
own,” and had set about doing it with thoroughness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>From the beautiful outer case to “the hollows
where a heart should be” she was formed to be the
one thing&mdash;a cunningly framed and articulated
mechanism for our entertainment. To us&mdash;whom
she so lightly regarded&mdash;she was foreordained to
carry a message of beauty, call us from our sordid
cares, and base ambitions, catch us up from the
grayness of the every day to the heights where once
more we caught a glimpse of the vision and the
dream. That we should work and sacrifice to help
her to her place, she, unconscious but impelled by
her destiny, felt, and made me feel. And having
gathered up our tribute she had left us, not ungratefully,
not having taken all and given nothing, but
in her own time and in her own way to pay us back
a hundredfold.</p>

<p>I thought it all out in the cab coming back from
the steamer, and I was content to have it so.</p>

<p>I had gone down to see her off&mdash;she wanted me
and no one else. We had passed up the dock amid
throngs of passengers and presently there were
stewards and cabin-boys running for her luggage,
and officers discreetly staring. When we bought the
ticket I had seen on the list the name of a countess,
and I learned that she was a royal lady traveling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>incognita with a maid. Everybody thought Lizzie
was the countess and I the maid. I looked the part,
trotting at her heels, carrying a large bandbox covered
with pink roses that had been overlooked in
the final scramble. She had a triumphal progress,
everything made easy, boys bearing the count’s
flowers going before her up the gangway, and I
following with the bandbox that nobody had offered
to take. Before I left I saw the royal lady leaning
on the railing, a pale person with the curling fringe
and prominent eyes of the typical British princess.
Nobody paid any attention to her, but when we went
exploring about the decks, looks followed us and
whispers buzzed.</p>

<p>As the big ship churned the water and ponderously
moved off, I stood on the pier’s edge and waved
to her. I was the tiny unit in the crowd&mdash;the nameless,
humdrum, earth-bound crowd&mdash;for whom she
was to weave the spell, and create the illusion.
Through a glaze of tears I watched her, tall and
splendid beside the dowdy princess&mdash;my beautiful
Lizzie, a real princess, going imperially to claim
her crown.</p>

<p>The windows are open and the spring night comes
in, soft as a caress. In the basement of the apartment-house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
some one is playing <i>Annie Laurie</i> on
the accordion, and in the back yards the servants are
chatting in the kitchen doors. From Mr. Hazard’s
room, below me, I can hear a low murmur of voices.
The others are in there talking it over, all, I know,
singing the praises of Lizzie, voicing hopes for her
success as deep and sincere as prayers. I can fancy
them, reclining on chairs and sofas, worn out by
their labors and feeling blankly that something has
gone out of their lives. A wild disturbing chord in
the day’s melody is hushed, a red thread in the
tapestry has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>I feel it, too.</p>

<p>And so the tale is ended. I don’t think I shall
ever write any more. In the autumn, when I
started this manuscript, I just intended to put down
the happenings of a lonely woman’s life, to read
over on evenings when looking back was pleasanter
than looking forward. Now, without intending to,
I have written a story, which is not my fault, as the
story happened to intrude itself into the lonely
woman’s life, greatly to her surprise, and a good
deal to her sorrow. But this is the finish of it.
There is no more to tell. The heroine has gone,
if to come back not the same heroine. The hero&mdash;you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
know as much about him as I do. And the
author&mdash;well, the author is just where she was, a
widow of thirty-three, doing light housekeeping in
an eighteen-foot apartment. It can’t be much of a
story because it hasn’t got anywhere; nobody has
died, nobody has married. So to myself&mdash;for I am
going to put this away in a trunk and never let a
soul see it&mdash;I make my bow as an author.</p>

<p>Good night, Evelyn Drake. As a sadder and
wiser woman I take my leave of you. Good-by.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his</span> has been a day of coincidences. They
began in the afternoon and ended an hour
ago. And now, past midnight, in my sitting-room
looking out on the lights of the Rond Point, like
Bret Harte’s heroine, “I am sitting alone by the fire,
dressed just as I came from the dance”&mdash;only it
wasn’t a dance, it was the opera.</p>

<p>But to get to the coincidences: This afternoon
I was unpacking an old trunk full of odds and ends
that I brought when we came to Paris last autumn,
and at the bottom of it I found the manuscript I
had written four years ago at Mrs. Bushey’s. I
laid it on the top to read over in some idle moment
when Roger wouldn’t catch me. For though we’ve
been married three years and talked over everything
that ever happened to either of us, Roger
doesn’t know the whole story of that winter.</p>

<p>Of course I <i>have</i> asked him if he wasn’t really in
love with Lizzie, and he always laughs and says
he wasn’t, that he was attracted by her and interested
in her as a type. I don’t contradict him&mdash;it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
best to let men rest peacefully in their innocent
self-delusions. Besides, if I pressed the subject we
might have to go on to Lizzie and Masters, and
that’s the part of the story he doesn’t know. Sometimes
I’ve thought I’d tell him and then I’ve always
stopped. Why should I? It’s all come out right.
Lizzie has traveled along the line of least resistance
in one direction and reached success, and Roger has
done the same thing in another and reached me. She
<i>must</i> be happy if fulfilled ambitions can do it, and
we <i>are</i>, with each other and last year&mdash;to crown it
all&mdash;our boy.</p>

<p>Well, I won’t go into that&mdash;I get too garrulous.
When a woman of thirty-six has a baby she never
gets over the pride and wonder of it.</p>

<p>We came over to Paris last autumn for Roger to
do some reading in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and
took this charming apartment near the Rond Point.
On bright mornings I can look into the little park
and see Roger Clements IX sitting out there in his
perambulator studying Parisian life. The day suddenly
strikes me as unusually fine and I go out and
sit on the bench beside him and we study Parisian

<p>Bother&mdash;I keep losing sight of the coincidences
which are the only reason I began to write this.
To resume:</p>

<p>During these four years we have tried to keep
track of Lizzie. It was difficult because, of course,
after the first few months, she stopped writing. If
it hadn’t been for Betty we should have lost her entirely,
but Betty, being the source of supplies, did
know, at least, her whereabouts. I may add, en
passant, that Mrs. Ferguson stood by her contract
to the end and now is enjoying the fruits thereof.
If she isn’t known as the patron of the greatest living
prima donna, she is known as a lady who made a
career possible to one of the rising singers of
Europe.</p>

<p>It was two years before Liza Bonaventura made
her first hit, as Elizabeth in <i>Tannhäuser</i> at Dresden.
Then we could follow her course in the
papers. I was as proud as if I’d done it myself
when I read of the excitement her Tosca created in
Berlin. After that there was a series of triumphs
in the smaller cities of Germany. She sang Carmen
at a special performance where the royal family
of something or other (I never can remember
those German names, if I did I couldn’t spell them)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>were present, and the kinglet or princeling of the
palace gave her a decoration.</p>

<p>After that the papers began to print stories about
her, which is the forerunner of fame. Some of them
were very funny, but most of them sounded true. I
don’t think her press-agent had to do much inventing.
All sorts of distinguished and wonderful men
were in love with her, but she would have none of
them. There were some anecdotes of her temper that
I am sure were genuine: how she once slapped a
rival prima donna in the face, and threw her slipper
at the head of a German Serene Highness who must
have lost his serenity for the moment.</p>

<p>When we came over here we had first-hand accounts
of her, from Americans who had been traveling
in Germany and were bursting with pride and
enthusiasm, and foreigners, who knew more and
were more temperate, but admitted that a new star
had risen on the horizon. “The handsomest woman
on the operatic stage since Malibran,” an old French
marquis, who had heard her as Tosca, told me one
night at dinner. Then some Italians who had seen
her Carmen were quite thrilled&mdash;such temperament&mdash;such
passion! Only Calve in her prime had
given such a dramatic portrayal of the fiery gipsy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>Opinions were divided about her Brunhilda. A
man Roger and I met at the house of a French
writer, where we sometimes go, told us that in
majesty and nobility she was incomparable, but that
her voice was inadequate. Still, she was young,
hardly in her full vigor, with care and study, aided
by her magnificent physique, she might yet rise to
the vocal requirements and then&mdash;he spread out his
hands and rolled up his eyes.</p>

<p>To-night I have come from the opera after hearing
her in <i>Carmen</i> and the effect is with me still&mdash;the
difficulty of shaking off the illusion and getting
back into life.</p>

<p>When I looked round from my seat in the orchestra
and saw that house, tier upon tier of faces,
hundreds of small pale ovals in ascending ranks, all
looking the same way, all waiting to hear Lizzie, I
couldn’t believe it. The great reverberating shell
of building held them like bees in a hive, buzzing
as they found places whence they could see the
queen bee. Through my own quivering expectancy
I could sense theirs, quieter but keen, and hear,
thrown back from the resonant walls and hollow
dome, the sounds of fluttered programs, rustling
fabrics, seats dropping and the fluctuant hum of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>voices&mdash;the exhilarating stir and bustle of a great
audience gradually settling into stillness. They
couldn’t have come to see Lizzie&mdash;so many people?
I was dreaming, it was somebody else.</p>

<p>The curtain lifted, the illuminated stage was set
in the gloom like a glowing picture. Figures moved
across it, voices sang, and then Carmen came with
the red flower in her mouth and it <i>was</i> Lizzie.</p>

<p>She was changed, matured, grown fuller and
handsomer, much handsomer&mdash;her beauty in full
flower. Her voice, too, was immensely improved; a
fine voice, full, clear and large, not, as she had once
said to me, one of the world’s great voices, but
enough for her, sufficient for what she has to do with
it. It is she, her personality, her magnetic and compelling
self, that is the potent thing.</p>

<p>Just as she used to seize upon and subdue us at
Mrs. Bushey’s, she seized upon and subdued those
close-packed silent ranks. From the brilliant picture,
cutting the darkness in front of us, she reached
out, groped for and grasped at every consciousness,
waiting to receive its impression. The other singers
lost their identity, faded into a colorless middle
distance, as we used to fade when Lizzie came
among us. She held the house, not so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>charmed as subjugated, more as the conqueror than
the enchantress. As the opera progressed I, with
my intimate knowledge of her, could see her gaining
force, could feel her fierce exhilaration, as she
realized her dominance was growing secure. Her
voice grew richer, her performance more boldly confident.
To me she reached her highest point in the
scene over the cards, her face stiffened to a tragic
mask, the cry of “<i>La Mort</i>” imbued with horror.
I can’t get it out of my mind&mdash;the Gitana, terrible
with her lust of life, suddenly looking into the eyes
of death.</p>

<p>I don’t know how to write about music, but it
wasn’t all music. It was the woman, the combination
of her great endowment with her power of
vitalizing an illusion, of putting blood and fire into
an imaginary creation, that made it so remarkable.
Her portrayal had not the vocal beauty or sophisticated
seduction of Calve’s. It was more primitive,
farther from the city and closer to the earth. It
seemed to me more Merimée’s Carmen than Bizet’s.
Of its kind, I, anyway&mdash;and Roger agreed with me&mdash;thought
it superb.</p>

<p>When it ended and she came before the curtain
there were bursts upon bursts of applause and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>“bravas” dropping from the galleries. I dare say
I will never again see a dream so completely realized.
Then the house began to empty itself down
that splendid stairway, a packed, slow-moving, voluble
crowd, praise, criticism, comment, flung back
and forth in the excited French fashion. I was
silent, holding Roger’s arm. A short fat Frenchman
behind me puffed almost into my ear, “<i>Quelle
femme, mais, quelle femme!</i>” A woman in front in a
Chinese opera cloak, leaned back to say over her
shoulder to a man squeezing past Roger, “<i>La voix
est bonne, mais n’est pas grande chose, mais c’est une
vraie artiste.</i>” And an angular girl at my elbow,
steering an old lady through cracks in the mass,
murmured ecstatically to herself, “<i>Mon Dieu, quelle</i>
temperament!” That was the word I heard oftenest,
temperament.</p>

<p>So in a solid brilliant throng we descended the
stairs, all engaged with Lizzie, discussing her, lauding her,
wondering at her&mdash;Lizzie, whom I had
seen in the making, learning to be the <i>vraie artiste</i>,
wounded, desperate and despairing that this
might be.</p>

<p>At the stair-foot&mdash;this is the last of the coincidences&mdash;the
crowd broke into lines and clumps, scattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
for the exits, and through a break I saw a
man standing by a pillar. He was looking up at
the descending people, but not as if he was interested
in them, in fact by the expression of his face I don’t
think he saw them. It was John Masters.</p>

<p>If he hadn’t been so absorbed he would have seen
me for I was close to him. But his eyes, set in that
fixity of inner vision, never swerved. He looked
much older, more lined, his bald spot grown all over
the top of his head. Though the glimpse I had of
him was fleeting, the crowd closing on him almost
directly, it was long enough for me to see that the
change was deeper than what the years might have
wrought. It was spiritual, diminished will power,
self-reliance grown weak. Shabby, thin, discouraged,
he suggested just one word&mdash;failure.</p>

<p>My hand involuntarily shut on Roger’s arm and
I whispered to him to hurry. I could not bear the
thought of meeting Masters&mdash;not for my sake but
for his. I couldn’t bear to look into his face and see
him try to smile.</p>

<p>It is nearly one. Roger is writing in his study
and Roger Clements IX is sleeping in his crib by
my bed. How strange it all is. Four years ago
not one of us, except Lizzie, the impossible and irresponsible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
had the least idea that any of us would
be where we are now. It was Lizzie, fighting out
her destiny, who crowded and elbowed us all into
our proper places, Lizzie, rapt in her vision, who
brought us ours.</p>

<p>This is the real end of my manuscript. It <i>has</i>
got somewhere after all. I can write “finis” with a
sense of its being the fitting word. But before I do
I want to just say that I made up my mind to-night,
while we were driving home in the taxi, that I’ll
never tell Roger now.</p>
